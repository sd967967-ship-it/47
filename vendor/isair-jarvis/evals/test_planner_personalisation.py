"""
Planner — Personalisation Detection (Live)

Guards that the task-list planner emits a ``searchMemory`` directive as
the first step for queries that implicitly depend on the user's own
interests, tastes, or history — even when the user did not use the word
"preference" or "history" in the query.

Motivating field incident (2026-04-24):
  User asked "Tell me some news that might interest me, Jarvis." The
  planner emitted ``webSearch query='current news'`` with no
  ``searchMemory`` step, so the engine skipped memory enrichment and the
  reply was a generic BBC front-page summary with no personalisation.

The planner's rule 2 already lists "preferences" as a trigger, but
gemma4:e2b doesn't pattern-match phrases like "interest me", "suggest
something for me", "what should I…" onto that category without concrete
examples. This eval asserts the prompt teaches the connection — adding
examples that name the exact linguistic shape of a personalisation
request.
