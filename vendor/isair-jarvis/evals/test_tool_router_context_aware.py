"""
Tool Router — Context-Aware Selection (Live)

Guards that the LLM tool router, when handed a compact summary of what the
main assistant can already see at reply time (current local time, resolved
location, recent dialogue), correctly returns 'none' for queries fully
answerable from that context — instead of embed-matching an adjacent tool.

Motivating field incident (2026-04-20):
  User asked "what time is it, Jarvis?". The router, having no view of the
  assistant's live context, picked `getWeather` as the closest temporal tool
  on the catalogue. With only `getWeather, stop` in the allowed list, the
  main model dutifully called getWeather and the reply parroted the weather
  back as if it had answered the time question.

The fix is upstream: pass the router the same compact context hint the
memory extractor already uses, and let it judge for itself whether the
query is answerable from context. Location may not always resolve, so the
hint degrades gracefully — the router falls back to content-based selection
when context is missing or partial, and should not over-commit to 'none'
for queries whose answer was NOT visible in the hint.

        When location failed to resolve (hint lacks it), a location query
        should not be silenced as 'none' — it must either route to a tool
        that can surface location or accept the fallback, but must not
        confidently claim the answer is in context when it isn't.

        Observed behaviour on gemma4:e2b: the mere presence of an
        ALREADY IN CONTEXT block primes the router to return 'none' for
        context-shaped queries even when the specific fact is absent
        from the block. Attempts to fix this purely at prompt level
        (adding "the block is NOT exhaustive" wording) regress the
        positive cases (time/date queries stop routing to 'none').
        The practical impact is bounded: when location genuinely fails
        to resolve, the follow-up layers (main model + memory recall)
        still have a chance to produce a sensible answer, and this only
        fires on the narrow path where the hint is partial.

        Parked as xfail rather than deleted so that a future router
        model (or prompt iteration) will surface the improvement as an
        unexpected pass. If fixed, delete the xfail branch and assert
        `selected != ["stop"]` unconditionally.
