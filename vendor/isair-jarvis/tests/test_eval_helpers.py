"""Unit tests for shared eval helpers.

These helpers shape what the eval suite actually measures — specifically
the fallback-reply detection that turns the malformed-output guard from
a silent shield into a loud failure. Pinning the helpers at unit level
means a typo or drift in the canned fallback strings in
``src/jarvis/reply/engine.py`` is caught without needing to run a live
LLM eval.
