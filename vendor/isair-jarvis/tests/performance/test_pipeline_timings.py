"""⏱️ Performance: time each LLM context in the reply pipeline.

Runs ``run_reply_engine`` N times against a live Ollama with a fixed tiny
prompt, records per-context timings via the monkey-patching recorder, and
asserts a few relative-shape invariants so the test fails when the pipeline
shape drifts (e.g. the evaluator becomes more expensive than the main turn).

Also includes a micro-benchmark that calls each configured model with a
tiny fixed prompt, giving a hardware baseline to diff against.

Run manually:
    pytest tests/performance/ -v -m performance -s

Requires:
    - Ollama reachable at http://localhost:11434
    - ``gemma4:e2b`` pulled (or override via env var)

The test is skipped automatically if Ollama is unreachable, so it's safe to
leave in the repo. Use ``-s`` to see the report table.
