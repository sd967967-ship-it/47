"""
🧠 Diary → graph console-logging regression tests.

After #282 added duplicate-skip on the cumulative-summary re-flush path,
the `🧠 Knowledge graph: learned N new facts` line in
``update_diary_from_dialogue_memory`` went silent on every flush past the
first: every re-extraction routed to a node that already contained the
fact, ``stored`` came back empty, and the print was gated on a non-empty
list. From the user's perspective the memory pipeline looked dead.

These tests lock in all four CLI states (mixed, only-new, all-duplicate,
silent-empty) plus singular pluralisation, so the regression can't slip
back in unnoticed.
