"""Tests for ``rewrite_all_diary_summaries`` — the LLM-driven bulk sweep
that walks every row in ``conversation_summaries`` and asks the chat model
to remove deflection narration.

Replaces the regex-based scrub sweep tests in #366. The previous regex
approach was English-only and accreted patterns whenever the model invented
a new shape. The current sweep delegates the semantic check to the chat
model itself, which is language-agnostic and improves automatically as
models upgrade.

The contract under test:
1. Walks every row, writes back rewritten text only when it changed.
2. Preserves ``ts_utc`` on rewrite — the audit trail must survive cleanup.
3. Empty rewrite → keep original, surface ``would_empty: true``.
4. LLM failure on a row → row left untouched, sweep continues.
5. Per-row write failure → row reported with ``error``, sweep continues.
6. Re-embeds rewritten rows when an embed model is configured.
7. Event payload contains counts/booleans only, never raw summary text.
