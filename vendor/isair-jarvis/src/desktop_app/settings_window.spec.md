# Settings Window Specification

Auto-generated settings UI that dynamically builds its interface from config field metadata.

## Overview

The Settings Window provides a graphical interface for editing `config.json` without requiring users to manually edit JSON. It reads the current config, presents categorised fields with appropriate input widgets, and saves changes back.

## Design Principles

1. **Metadata-driven**: All fields are defined in a `FIELD_METADATA` registry. Adding a new config parameter to the settings UI requires only adding a `FieldMeta` entry — no widget code changes.
2. **Minimal config files**: Only non-default values are written to `config.json`. Removing a field from the config reverts it to the default.
3. **Preserves unknown keys**: Keys not managed by the UI (e.g. `mcps`, `_config_version`, future additions) are preserved when saving.
4. **Theme-consistent**: Uses the shared Jarvis theme from `themes.py`.

## Architecture

```
FieldMeta (dataclass)
  ├── key: str           # config.json key name
  ├── label: str         # Human-readable label
  ├── description: str   # Tooltip text
  ├── category: str      # Tab grouping key
  ├── field_type: str    # "bool" | "int" | "float" | "str" | "choice" | "device" | "list"
  ├── choices            # For "choice"/"device": [(value, display), ...]
  ├── min_val / max_val  # Numeric bounds
  ├── step               # Increment step
  ├── suffix             # Unit label (e.g. "s", "ms", "WPM")
  └── nullable           # Whether None is valid (shows placeholder)
```

## Widget Mapping

| field_type | Widget | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `bool` | QCheckBox | |
| `int` | QSpinBox | With bounds, step, suffix |
| `int` (nullable) | QCheckBox + QSpinBox | Checkbox enables/disables the spinbox |
| `float` | QDoubleSpinBox | With bounds, step, suffix |
| `str` | QLineEdit | Placeholder if nullable |
| `password` | QLineEdit (EchoMode.Password) | Masked input for API keys; same value extraction as `str` |
| `choice` | QComboBox | Pre-defined options |
| `device` | QComboBox | Dynamically populated from sounddevice |
| `list` | QListWidget + Add/Edit/Remove buttons | Stores as JSON array in config |

## Layout

The settings window uses a sidebar navigation pattern: a fixed-width `QListWidget` on the left lists categories, and a `QStackedWidget` on the right shows the selected category's form. This avoids horizontal overflow from too many tabs.

## Categories (Sidebar Order)

1. LLM & AI Models
2. LLM Provider
3. Text-to-Speech
4. Piper TTS
5. Chatterbox TTS
6. Voice Input (includes microphone device selection)
7. Wake Word
8. Speech Recognition (Whisper)
9. Voice Activity Detection
10. Timing & Windows
11. Memory & Dialogue
12. Location
13. Features (includes web search, Wikipedia fallback, low-power mode, startup tune, and dictation toggles)
14. MCP Servers
15. Advanced

### LLM Provider

Selects the local runtime that serves the LLM and holds the provider-aware
connection fields: `llm_provider` (Ollama / OpenAI-compatible), `llm_base_url`,
`llm_api_key` (password), `llm_chat_model`, and the four `embedding_*` fields
(`embedding_provider`, `embedding_base_url`, `embedding_api_key`,
`embedding_model`). The model fields are free-text `str` — an OpenAI-compatible
server's model name is not in the Ollama `SUPPORTED_CHAT_MODELS` catalogue.

Every connection/credential/model field is nullable: leaving it empty falls
back to the Ollama settings on the "LLM & AI Models" page. A default Ollama
install therefore never needs to open this page, and the minimal-config save
behaviour keeps these keys out of `config.json` until the user sets them.

Unlike the setup wizard's provider page, the settings window does **not**
clear the OpenAI-compatible fields when the user switches `llm_provider` back
to Ollama: it is metadata-driven with no cross-field logic, and a blanket
clear would wipe the supported "Ollama chat + remote embeddings" split
(`llm_provider: ollama` with `embedding_provider: openai_compatible`). Stale
values are harmless because the backend resolves per-provider: the Ollama path
uses `ollama_base_url` / `ollama_chat_model` and `OllamaBackend` ignores any
API key. To drop a leftover value, clear that field and save.

### Features

The Features category exposes user-facing runtime toggles that do not need a
dedicated page:

- `web_search_enabled`
- `brave_search_api_key`
- `wikipedia_fallback_enabled`
- `low_power_mode`
- `tune_enabled`
- `dictation_enabled`
- `dictation_hotkey`
- `dictation_filler_removal`
- `dictation_custom_dictionary`

`low_power_mode` is a boolean toggle. When enabled, the voice listener skips
LLM startup warmup and the Ollama keep-alive windows used by warmup and the
intent judge are short. The setting is saved only when it differs from the
default, like every other metadata-managed field.

## Hardware Device Selection

The Voice Input tab includes a device dropdown populated at window open time via `sounddevice.query_devices()`. It lists all input-capable devices with their index and name. The stored value is the device index as a string, or empty string for system default.

## Save Behaviour

- Only keys that differ from `get_default_config()` are written.
- Existing keys not managed by the UI are preserved (e.g. `mcps`, `active_profiles`, `wake_aliases`, `allowlist_bundles`, `stop_commands`).
- After save, a dialog confirms success and reminds the user to restart.
- If the daemon is running when save completes, the tray app offers to restart it.

## Reset to Defaults

- Prompts for confirmation.
- Resets all widget values to `get_default_config()` values.
- Does NOT immediately save — user must still click Save.

## Integration

- Accessed via "⚙️ Settings" in the system tray menu.
- Opens as a modal QDialog.
- Lazy-imported to avoid loading sounddevice at startup.

## MCP Servers Section

The MCP Servers category is **not** metadata-driven — it uses a custom page because `mcps` is a complex dict structure.

### Layout

- Description label explaining what MCP servers are
- List widget showing configured servers (display name from catalogue if recognised, otherwise `🔌 {name}`)
- Buttons: **Add from Catalogue**, **Add Custom**, **Edit**, **Remove**
- Detail panel showing the selected server's name, command, args, and env vars

### Add from Catalogue

Opens `_MCPCatalogueDialog` showing all entries from `mcp_catalogue.CATALOGUE`. Already-configured servers appear checked and disabled. Servers that require an API key show a 🔑 badge. When the user confirms, they're prompted for any needed API keys.

### Add Custom

Opens `_MCPEditDialog` with fields for name, command, args (space-separated), and env vars (KEY=VALUE pairs). Validates that name and command are non-empty.

### Edit

Opens `_MCPEditDialog` pre-filled with the selected server's config. Name is read-only during edit.

### Remove

Prompts for confirmation, then removes the server from the in-memory dict.

### Save Behaviour

On save, the `mcps` dict is written to config.json if non-empty, or removed entirely if empty. On reset, all MCPs are cleared.

## Fields NOT Exposed in UI

These fields are managed elsewhere or are too complex for a simple form:

- `db_path` / `sqlite_vss_path` — internal storage paths
- `active_profiles` — list managed by setup wizard
- `allowlist_bundles` — list of bundle IDs
- `wake_aliases` — list of strings (complex editing)
- `stop_commands` / `stop_command_fuzzy_ratio` — list of strings
- `use_stdin` — developer/CLI flag
- `voice_debug` — environment variable only
- `whisper_min_audio_duration` / `whisper_min_word_length` — rarely changed advanced params
- `vad_frame_ms` / `vad_pre_roll_ms` — low-level VAD timing
