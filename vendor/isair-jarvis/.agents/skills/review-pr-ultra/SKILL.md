  Heavyweight multi-agent adversarial PR review. Spawns 5 parallel specialist
  agents (correctness, security, performance, maintainability, completeness)
  then a verifier agent that challenges every finding. Only verified issues
  survive. Use for high-risk changes, security-sensitive areas, large diffs,
  or when the user asks for a deep/thorough/ultra review. For routine reviews,
  prefer `/review-pr` — it's cheaper and faster.

# Multi-Agent Adversarial PR Review

You are an orchestrator for a thorough, multi-perspective pull request review.
Spawn specialist review agents in parallel, then run a verification pass to
filter out false positives. Higher token cost than `/review-pr` — use
intentionally.

## Step 1 — Gather PR Context

Determine the PR to review:
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it (a PR number, URL, or branch name).
- Otherwise, detect the current branch and find its open PR.

```bash
gh pr view <PR> --json title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefOid,labels,files,additions,deletions,commits,reviews,comments,statusCheckRollup
gh pr diff <PR>
```

Read the project's `AGENTS.md` for coding conventions the review should enforce.
Store all context — include it in each specialist agent's prompt.

## Step 2 — Spawn Specialist Agents (Parallel)

Launch **all five** specialist agents simultaneously using the task tool.
Each agent receives the full diff, changed file list, PR description, and
project conventions. Each must output a structured list of findings.

### Agent 1: Correctness Reviewer
Focus: Logic bugs, edge cases, regressions.
- Off-by-one errors, null/undefined handling, race conditions
- Broken invariants, incorrect control flow
- State management issues (missing assignments, leaked state)
- Regressions: does this change break existing behaviour?
- Read surrounding code (not just the diff) to understand context

### Agent 2: Security Reviewer
Focus: Vulnerabilities and unsafe patterns.
- Injection (SQL, command, XSS, path traversal)
- Authentication/authorisation bypass
- Secrets or credentials in code
- Unsafe deserialisation, SSRF, open redirects
- Cryptographic misuse, insecure randomness
- Dependency vulnerabilities (if new deps added)

### Agent 3: Performance Reviewer
Focus: Efficiency and scalability.
- N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, missing caching
- O(n²) or worse algorithms where linear is possible
- Blocking calls in async/event-loop contexts
- Memory leaks, unbounded growth (queues, buffers, caches)
- Unnecessary I/O, redundant network calls

### Agent 4: Maintainability & Simplicity Reviewer
Focus: Design quality, readability, and simplicity.
- SOLID principle violations, excessive coupling, low cohesion
- Code duplication (DRY violations)
- Naming clarity (variables, functions, classes)
- Missing or misleading comments/docstrings
- Overly complex logic: nested control flow, cleverness that obscures intent,
  or high cognitive load where a more direct expression would do
- Unnecessary abstraction, indirection, or over-engineering (e.g. frameworks,
  generics, or extra layers a straightforward implementation would avoid)
- Dead code, unused parameters/imports, leftover debug statements
- Inconsistency with project conventions (from AGENTS.md)

### Agent 5: Completeness Reviewer
Focus: What's missing.
- Missing test coverage for new/changed code paths
- Missing error handling for failure modes
- Undocumented behaviour changes (README, specs, CHANGELOG)
- Spec drift: do changes contradict any spec files?
- Missing migration steps or configuration updates
- Edge cases not addressed in the implementation

### Agent Prompt Template

Each agent's prompt MUST include:
1. The full diff
2. The changed file list
3. The PR description
4. Relevant project conventions from AGENTS.md
5. Instruction to READ the surrounding code in changed files (not just the diff lines) for full context
6. Instruction to output findings as a structured list:

```
For each finding, output:
- **File**: path/to/file.py:LINE
- **Severity**: critical / high / medium / low
- **Category**: bug / security / performance / design / missing
- **Confidence**: high / medium / low
- **Description**: What the issue is and why it matters
- **Suggestion**: Concrete fix or alternative approach
```

7. Instruction: if no issues found in your area, explicitly state "No issues found" — do not invent findings to appear thorough.
8. Instruction: only report issues with confidence >= medium. Do not report style nits unless they violate project conventions.

## Step 3 — Verification Phase (Adversarial)

After ALL specialist agents complete, spawn a single **Verifier Agent** that
receives every finding from all specialists. The verifier's job is to
**challenge and disprove** each finding:

### Verifier Agent Instructions

You are a devil's advocate. For EACH finding from the specialist reviewers:

1. **Read the actual code** (not just the diff) — the "bug" may be handled
   elsewhere in the codebase.
2. **Check if the concern is mitigated** by framework defaults, type system
   guarantees, or existing validation.
3. **Verify the severity** — is this really critical, or is it a cosmetic issue
   dressed up as a bug?
4. **Check for duplicates** — multiple specialists may report the same issue
   in different words.
5. **Assess confidence** — is the specialist making assumptions about runtime
   behaviour without evidence?

For each finding, output one of:
- **VERIFIED** — the issue is real and correctly categorised
- **DOWNGRADED** — the issue exists but severity/confidence should be lower (explain why)
- **DISMISSED** — the issue is a false positive (explain why)
- **DUPLICATE** — already covered by another finding (reference which one)

## Step 4 — Synthesise Final Report

Collect all VERIFIED and DOWNGRADED findings. Produce a final review report:

### Report Format

```markdown
## PR Review: <PR title>

### Summary
<2-3 sentence overview of the PR and overall assessment>

### Critical / High Issues
<Only VERIFIED findings with severity critical or high>

### Medium Issues
<VERIFIED findings with severity medium>

### Suggestions
<DOWNGRADED findings and low-severity items, briefly>

### What Looks Good
<Positive observations — good patterns, thorough tests, clean design>

### Verdict
<One of: APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT>
<Brief justification>
```

### Verdict rules

| State | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| ≥ 1 VERIFIED critical or high | **REQUEST_CHANGES** |
| All highs downgraded; only mediums verified | **COMMENT** |
| No verified ≥ medium | **APPROVE** |

### Report rules
- Lead with the most important issues
- Be specific: include file paths, line numbers, and code snippets
- Be constructive: every criticism must include a concrete suggestion
- Acknowledge what's done well — reviews should be balanced
- If no critical/high issues exist, lean towards APPROVE
- Use the project's conventions (British English, emojis for emphasis)

## Step 5 — Present and Ask for Go-Ahead

After the report is ready, offer to post it to GitHub as inline comments. Use
the `ask` tool:

```markdown
**Review complete for #{pr_number}.** Ready to post to GitHub?

I can post the verified findings as inline comments (one review, anchored to
specific lines) with a brief summary body. The full report is above.
```

Only proceed after user confirmation. Do not post automatically.

## Step 6 — Post to GitHub (on confirmation)

Post a single review with all inline comments in one API call:

```bash
gh pr view <PR> --json headRefOid
```

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR>/reviews --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "commit_id": "<HEAD_SHA>",
  "event": "APPROVE",
  "body": "<2-3 line summary>",
  "comments": [
    { "path": "src/file.py", "line": 42, "body": "<terse note>" }
  ]
}
EOF
```

| Verdict | `event` |
|---------|---------|
| APPROVE | `APPROVE` |
| REQUEST_CHANGES | `REQUEST_CHANGES` |
| COMMENT | `COMMENT` |

- `line` is the 1-indexed line in the post-change file (right side), must fall within a changed hunk.
- `commit_id` — set to the PR head SHA to avoid resolution issues.
- `body` — keep it to 2–3 lines; the full report is already in-thread.
- Do NOT post individual comments via `POST /pulls/{number}/comments` — that creates separate threads. The `reviews` endpoint with a `comments` array keeps them together.
- Only include VERIFIED findings (severity >= medium). Write each as a terse, conversational dev note — one point, fix implied.
- Lead with the highest-severity finding first.
- Confirm the PR URL and verdict once posted.

## Important Guidelines

- **Do NOT make changes to code** — this is a read-only review
- **Be thorough but not noisy** — quality over quantity
- **Respect the author's intent** — understand why before criticising what
- When spawning agents, always include the full diff and context in the prompt — agents have no memory of this conversation
