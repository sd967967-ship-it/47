"""Procedural "voice orb" renderer for the free-floating desktop overlay.

This is the desktop twin of the in-app orb (``components/agentic/VoiceOrb.tsx``):
a luminous, cloud-filled sphere made of softly evolving procedural weather
rather than a glossy gradient ball. A low-resolution fractal field is colour
mapped through the product's monochrome ramp and enlarged with
interpolation, which is what produces organic depth without visible bands,
outlines, rotating particles or image assets. Voice states change pace,
breathing, turbulence and highlight energy; the colour identity stays stable.

Why a port instead of hosting the web canvas: the browser orb can only ever
live inside the app window. A user who wants the orb ON the desktop — dragged
to whichever monitor they like, above every other window — needs the same
frameless, always-on-top surface the mascot and the Jarvis Bar already use, and
that surface is fed by ``render(t, mode, ext_level) -> PIL.Image``. So the field
is reproduced here in numpy against the SAME constants as the TypeScript
version; the two are meant to look alike, and the guard test pins the palette
and the per-mode motion table rather than a pixel hash.

Two properties are load-bearing for the overlay, not cosmetic:

* **Hard circular edge.** The Windows surface keys out one exact colour
  (magenta) to make a pixel transparent. Any pixel that is a *blend* of orb and
  key colour survives as a pink fringe, so the silhouette is a binary mask — no
  alpha feathering outward. macOS derives its alpha from the same exact-match
  key (``overlay.key_to_alpha``), so the rule holds there too.
* **Capped field cadence.** The overlay's frame loop runs at ~60 fps; the
  procedural field is recomputed at 20 fps (the web orb's rate) and re-composed
  cheaply in between. Breathing still moves every frame, because that is a
  geometry change, not a field change.
