"""Jarvis-Orb as a native desktop overlay (Tkinter + Pillow + numpy).

History of approaches tried and why we landed on Tkinter:
    - pywebview + WebView2 Canvas: WebView2 renders via DirectComposition,
      so SetWindowRgn/LWA_COLORKEY have no effect → a rectangular box remained.
    - PySide6 + WA_TranslucentBackground: Qt6+DWM on Windows 11 frequently
      delivers only an opaque black backing buffer + a DropShadow frame
      instead of real transparency. Dozens of known Qt bugs, no robust fix.
    - Tkinter + wm_attributes('-transparentcolor'): uses the classic
      Win32 SetLayeredWindowAttributes API with LWA_COLORKEY. Stable since
      Windows 2000, independent of DWM compositor quirks. Magenta (#FF00FF)
      becomes pixel-perfect transparent — Windows routes those pixels
      straight through to the desktop.

Rendering pipeline:
    numpy computes a 108x108 RGB buffer per frame. Radial gradients,
    additive swirls, and the bright core are executed as vector operations
    on the distance arrays (precomputed once in the constructor).
    Hard circle edge, no alpha fade outward — otherwise pink anti-aliasing
    pixels would appear at the color-key boundary. Pillow wraps the array
    into a PhotoImage that Tkinter renders onto a Canvas.

Public API:
    overlay = OrbOverlay(style="mascot")    # SWG/Gigi PNG
    overlay = OrbOverlay(style="voice_orb") # procedural weather sphere
    overlay.start()                         # blocks until mainloop exit
    overlay.show(mode="listen")             # voice modes: idle/listen/speak/think
    overlay.show(mode="speak")
    overlay.show(mode="dictate")            # dictation modes: recording ...
    overlay.show(mode="dictate_transcribing")  # ... and transcribing
    overlay.hide()
    overlay.set_level(0.42)
    overlay.set_style("mascot")             # runtime switch, no restart

ENV overrides:
    JARVIS_ORB_STYLE=mascot|voice_orb       # legacy "orb" requests are ignored
    JARVIS_ORB_MASCOT_PATH=<path.png>       # alternative mascot path

Standalone test:
    python -m ui.orb.overlay                    # demo sequence (mascot)
    python -m ui.orb.overlay --sticky           # permanently visible (preview)

    Voice modes keep their historical behaviour to the letter: a live level

    The two dictation modes are deliberately NOT variations of ``listen``:

    * ``dictate`` — recording. The dictation session feeds the very same mic

      equalizer. It is clamped up from a floor, because a quiet moment while
      recording must still read as "I am listening", never as a dead mascot.
    * ``dictate_transcribing`` — the key is released and the mic feed has
      stopped, so the last sample would otherwise freeze the mascot at whatever
      loudness the user happened to end on. This mode therefore ignores the
      stale level outright and runs a steady work pulse instead — the mascot's
      equivalent of the bar's orbital core.

    ``notice`` — something the user asked for did not happen. Like
    ``dictate_transcribing`` it IGNORES the live level: the mascot must not
    shimmer along with a microphone it is not using while it says the opposite.
    It runs a low, slow breath — clearly awake (a dead-flat mascot reads as a
    crashed one) and clearly not listening. On this surface the reason itself
    is legible in the speech bubble, so the energy only has to avoid
