"""Bus bridge: connects the Jarvis EventBus to the orb overlay.

The orb itself knows neither Jarvis core, EventBus, nor supervisor states.
This bridge subscribes to `SystemStateChanged` and translates the high-level
states (IDLE/LISTENING/THINKING/SPEAKING) into orb API calls.

The bridge additionally manages the mic-listener lifecycle:
    - LISTENING  → start the mic stream, pump live level to the orb
    - THINKING / SPEAKING / IDLE → stop the mic stream (privacy + CPU)

Animation mapping (phase 1c-add 2026-04-24):
    LISTENING                → 'wave' (greet on wake word)
    THINKING                 → 'think' (loop bubble), stopped on transition
    SPEAKING                 → a light 'nod' (subtle acknowledgement)
    SPEAKING → IDLE          → 'salute' (hangup gesture, then hide)
    Idle scheduler           → every 30-90s a random animation from the pool

Architecture rule: the UI layer (L7) subscribes, the business layer (L2
speech, L6 supervisor) publishes. The bridge lives in the UI layer.

Threading:
    subscribe() handlers are called from the asyncio event loop; they call
    the orb API (show/hide/set_mode), which internally queues the UI
    mutation onto the Tk main thread via `root.after(0, ...)`.
    The idle scheduler runs as an asyncio.Task on the same loop and
    only uses the thread-safe orb API.

          one for a paste that landed. A sentence only buys the DWELL, which is
          what keeps it readable on the surfaces that do render it.
        * The words did not arrive (``clipboard_only`` — the OS blocked the
          paste — ``unavailable``, ``empty``, ``failed``, or an outcome from a
          newer install we do not know) → the notice look, which is what that
