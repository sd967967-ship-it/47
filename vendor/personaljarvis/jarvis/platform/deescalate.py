"""Start a child process WITHOUT the elevation this process is carrying.

Why this exists: an app that was ever launched elevated stays elevated across
every in-app restart, and while elevated it is unreachable for dictation apps,
text expanders, and password-manager auto-type (see
``jarvis/platform/input_isolation.py`` for the measurement). Recovering has to
happen from inside the app — telling a user to hunt down how their app came to
be elevated is not a fix.

**How.** We need a *primary* token that represents "an ordinary app of this
user", then launch through ``CreateProcessWithTokenW`` (which needs
``SeImpersonatePrivilege`` — an elevated process holds it). Two sources are
tried in order:

1. **The desktop shell's token.** Explorer always runs as the plain interactive
   user, and an elevated process may open it because access flows downward. This
   is the primary path and the only one that also works with UAC switched off.
2. **Our own token's filtered companion** (``TokenLinkedToken``). Kept as a
   fallback, but it is *not* reliable: unless the caller holds
   ``SeTcbPrivilege``, Windows hands that token out at *identification* level,
   and a primary token cannot be duplicated from one — measured live as error
   1346, ``ERROR_BAD_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL``.

**When it cannot work** (reported honestly, never faked): a session with no
shell and no usable companion token — a Windows service, a SYSTEM context, or a
headless host. POSIX is a documented no-op: dropping from root to "whoever ran
sudo" is guesswork that would strand file ownership, so we tell the user instead
of guessing.
