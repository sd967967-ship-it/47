"""Cross-platform primary-monitor resolution (audit G8a).

Computer-Use works on ONE monitor (the "main" one) by default. Picking it
robustly matters: a secondary screen LEFT of primary has negative virtual-X where
clicks misfire, so capturing/acting on the wrong screen breaks every mission.

The hard part is identifying the primary WITHOUT assuming it sits at virtual
origin (0,0): on Windows it always does, but on macOS/Linux the primary can be
anywhere in the virtual desktop. ``native_primary_origin`` asks the OS for the
true primary's top-left (Win ``MONITORINFOF_PRIMARY``, macOS ``CGMainDisplayID``,
X11 ``XRRGetOutputPrimary``); ``resolve_primary_monitor`` matches that against the
enumerated monitor list, with config overrides for ``largest`` or an explicit id.

Everything is best-effort and never raises: an unavailable native query degrades
to the (0,0)-origin heuristic, and an unknown override falls back to primary
rather than silently picking a wrong screen.
