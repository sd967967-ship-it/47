"""Autostart-at-login seam — protocol + wire types (the 7th cross-platform port).

Login autostart follows the established "six ports" pattern (CLAUDE.md →
*Cross-platform desktop features*): one ``Protocol`` + one per-OS implementation
+ a capability factory + a graceful logged null-fallback (AD-5/AD-6).

Nothing in this package imports a platform-only module at module scope (HN-7);
the Windows implementation shells out to PowerShell (subprocess), exactly like
``scripts/install_shortcuts.py`` does today, so there is no ``pywin32`` import and
no new dependency in any extras group. macOS/Linux are pure ``pathlib`` writes.
