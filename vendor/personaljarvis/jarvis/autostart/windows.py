"""Windows login autostart via a per-user **logon Scheduled Task** (with a
``shell:startup`` ``.lnk`` fallback).

Why a scheduled task and not just the startup shortcut? Windows 11 processes
``shell:startup`` items through Explorer's **throttled, serialized startup queue**
— one item at a time, ~30 s apart. On a machine with many startup programs the
Jarvis shortcut fires 4-8 minutes after login (measured: a sibling ``.lnk`` in the
same Startup folder fired ~9 min in), so the user reasonably concludes "autostart
is broken". The Task Scheduler is a separate subsystem that is **not** subject to
that throttle: a logon-triggered task starts Jarvis within seconds of login.

The trade-off: *registering* a task needs a one-time elevation (UAC) — a
non-elevated process is denied (verified on Windows 11, even for an Administrator
account's filtered token). *Reading* a task's state does not. So:

* The task is (un)registered only on an **interactive** call (Settings toggle /
  wizard), where a single UAC prompt is contextually expected. Once created it
  fires every login forever and Jarvis itself runs **non-elevated**
  (``RunLevel=Limited`` → microphone access, the "no Windows Service" rule AP-17).
* The silent **boot reconcile** (``interactive=False``) never prompts. If the task
  is missing it ensures the no-elevation ``.lnk`` fallback so autostart still
  works (just possibly delayed). The Settings panel surfaces an "enable instant
  start" affordance to upgrade the fallback to a task.

Everything shells out to PowerShell (subprocess) exactly like
``scripts/install_shortcuts.py`` — **no ``pywin32`` dependency**. The
script-assembly functions are pure (unit-testable cross-platform); only execution
requires Windows. The ``.lnk`` builders (``build_create_script`` /
``build_read_script``) are unchanged and still used for the fallback.
