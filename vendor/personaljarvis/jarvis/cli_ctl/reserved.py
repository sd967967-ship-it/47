"""Reserved control-command names for the unified ``jarvis`` entry point.

``jarvis/__main__.py`` forwards an invocation to the control CLI (the Typer app
in ``jarvis.cli_ctl.__main__``) only when the first argument is one of these
names — or one of the control-global options. Everything else (bare ``jarvis``,
``jarvis serve``, every launcher flag such as ``--wizard`` / ``--check``) keeps
its existing launcher behavior untouched.

The set is frozen up front to include the command groups that later waves add,
so dispatch is stable as the curated surface grows. A parity test
(``tests/unit/cli_ctl/test_dispatch.py``) asserts none of these collide with a
launcher flag or command.
