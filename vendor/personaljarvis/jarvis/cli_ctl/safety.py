"""Non-interactive safety gate for mutating CLI commands.

The Jarvis CLI is a thin client over the REST API and therefore inherits every
server-side guardrail (risk tiers, the atomic config-write pipeline, audit). But
an external coding agent issuing mutations non-interactively is a new risk
surface, so the CLI adds defense in depth on the client side:

* **read** (``GET``): never gated.
* **mutating** (``POST`` / ``PUT`` / ``PATCH`` / ``DELETE``): require confirmation.
  In an interactive TTY the user is prompted; when piped/non-interactive the
  command **fails closed** unless ``--yes`` / ``-y`` (or ``JARVIS_CLI_ASSUME_YES``)
  is set.
* **dangerous** (every ``DELETE`` plus an explicit path denylist — restart,
  place an outbound call, dispatch a mission, …): always require an explicit ``--yes``; an
  interactive ``[y/N]`` prompt alone does not authorize them.

``--dry-run`` short-circuits any command: it prints the exact request that would
be sent (method, path, body, whether auth is attached) and sends nothing. This is
the safe introspection path for an agent.

Three signals mark a request destructive, strictest wins: every ``DELETE``
(method alone), the small path denylist below (legacy floor), and the
server-declared ``x-jarvis-dangerous`` OpenAPI flag that the dynamic layer
reads per operation and passes in as ``dangerous=True`` (authoritative for
new routes; enforced repo-wide by ``scripts/ci/check_danger_metadata.py``).
A flag can only ADD strictness — nothing downgrades the denylist.
