"""The reasoning trace of one turn, as a record that survives the turn.

While a turn runs, the UI watches the bus and draws the steps live — the
brain call, every tool the assistant reached for, the worker it delegated
to, what it looked at on screen, the sentence it wrote next to each call
(``ActionProposed.rationale``). Until now that picture lived only in the
window that happened to be open: reopen the chat and the answer stood there
with no sign of how it came about.

This module keeps the same events the UI reads, in a bounded ring, so the
reply path can attach the slice that belongs to its turn to the stored
message (``ChatStore.add_message(trace=…)``). The stored shape is the EVENT
LIST — ``{name, ts_ms, payload}`` — not pre-rendered steps: the frontend
already owns the one mapping from events to human-readable rows
(``lib/thinkingSteps.ts``), and a stored trace is replayed through exactly
that mapping, so live and archived traces can never drift apart.

Payloads are reduced to the handful of keys the mapping reads and every
free-text value passes :func:`jarvis.core.redact.safe_preview` — a tool's
arguments can carry anything the user typed, and the trace lands in a file.

Read-only wildcard subscriber, never on the hot path (AP-9); every hook is
wrapped so a malformed event can never reach the publisher (AP-18).
