"""Durable, segmented chat store backed by sqlite3.

History: this began as an in-memory dict for Phase 1a, with the explicit plan
to swap in SQLite for Phase 2 ("Persistenz (SQLite) kommt in Phase 2 …"). The
Chats conversation manager (2026-05-30) is that swap. The public async API is
unchanged (``create_thread`` / ``ensure_thread`` / ``add_message`` /
``list_threads`` / ``get_thread``) so the launcher + desktop wiring is
untouched; new capabilities (``delete_thread``, ``prune_older_than``,
per-thread ``preview`` / ``title`` / ``updated_at_ns``) are additive.

Storage mirrors ``jarvis/sessions/store.py``: a single ``sqlite3`` connection
in WAL mode, guarded by a ``threading.Lock`` (writes happen from the asyncio
loop, reads from FastAPI route handlers — both on the same in-process loop, but
the lock keeps us safe if a future caller reads from a worker thread). The
``db_path`` defaults to ``:memory:`` so existing callers/tests that construct
``ChatStore(bus=...)`` keep working in-process without touching disk; the boot
path passes ``data/chats.db`` for real persistence.

Ordering is by SQLite ``rowid`` (strictly monotonic per insert), not by
wall-clock — Windows ``time_ns()`` resolution can otherwise tie two fast
appends and make message/thread order non-deterministic.
