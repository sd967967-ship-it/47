"""Pre-seed each agent's "trusted folder" config so no trust dialog appears.

Detached external terminals can't be answered programmatically, so the robust
way to "skip the trust prompt" is to mark the project folder as trusted in each
CLI's own config BEFORE launching — exactly what the CLI writes when the user
clicks "trust" once.

**Which file, and what to put in it, is registry data** — a
:class:`~jarvis.workspace.agents.TrustSpec` on the agent entry — not a chain of
``if name == ...`` here. Two things fall out of that. A CLI whose config happens
to have the same shape as another's (a launch profile over the same binary)
reuses the writer instead of earning a fourth branch, and a newly registered CLI
gets trust seeding by declaring where its file lives, with no edit to this
module at all. Only two *shapes* exist, and they are the two file formats:

- a **JSON** object with a per-project entry — Claude Code's ``~/.claude.json``,
  ``projects[<path>].hasTrustDialogAccepted = true``. It keys by the cwd string
  as it saw it, and the form (drive case / slash style) matters, so a spec may
  ask for both the native and forward-slash variants to be seeded.
- a **TOML** table — Codex's ``$CODEX_HOME/config.toml``,
  ``[projects.'<path>'] trust_level = "trusted"``.

A third JSON shape exists: a **flat scalar map** (Antigravity's
``trustedFolders.json`` is ``{ "<path>": "TRUST_FOLDER" }``). ``TrustSpec.scalar``
selects it; writing an object there would be a file the CLI no longer reads.

Both writes are atomic (temp file + ``os.replace``) and idempotent, and never
clobber unrelated keys. A spec may ask for a one-time backup before the first
mutation — worth it for a file the user's own CLI configuration shares, and
pointless for one we created. If a write fails we report it honestly — we never
claim "skipped" when it wasn't.

``config_dirs`` covers the second place a CLI reads that file from. A terminal
running on an ADDED subscription resolves its whole configuration from the
account's own directory (:mod:`jarvis.agent_accounts`), so trust seeded into the
machine's default config is invisible to it and the pane opens on the very
dialog this module exists to skip. Callers that know which account a terminal
will run on pass its directory here; every other caller keeps the old behaviour
untouched.
