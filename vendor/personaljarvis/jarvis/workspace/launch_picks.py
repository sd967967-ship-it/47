"""How a coding CLI takes a model, an effort level and a permission stance.

A workspace pane runs a vendor CLI interactively in a PTY, and every one of
them takes those three picks the same way: as flags on the launch argv. What
differs is the spelling — ``--model`` here, ``-m`` there, a ``-c key=value``
config override somewhere else — and which permission words the binary knows.

So each entry DECLARES its spelling (``WorkspaceAgent.launch_picks``) and this
module turns a pick into argv. Nothing here branches on a product name (AP-21):
an entry that declares nothing simply offers no picks, and a CLI added later
gets them by filling the field in.

The vocabulary is not invented here either. The ladders and the model lists are
the agent chat's (:mod:`jarvis.agent_chat.catalog`, ``effort``, ``permissions``)
via one ``provider`` id per entry, so a pick means the same thing in a workspace
pane as it does in a chat session, and a model added to the catalog appears in
both.

**Every value that reaches an argv is checked against what the entry offers.**
A permission mode has to be one this CLI declared, an effort level one its
ladder holds, and a model either one of the offered ids or — for a CLI whose
list is the user's own (OpenCode's ``provider/model``) — a plain identifier.
Anything else is dropped rather than passed on: these strings arrive from a
browser, and an argv is the one place a stray ``--flag`` would be read as an
instruction.
