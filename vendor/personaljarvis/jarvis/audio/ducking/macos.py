"""macOS AppleScript audio ducking (tiered: known players, then master volume).

Lowers the app-internal ``sound volume`` of the known media players (Music,
Spotify) via ``osascript`` for the duration of a voice session and restores
the previous volume afterwards. Optionally (opt-in) falls back to lowering the
MASTER output volume when no known player was ducked — note the master
fallback also lowers Jarvis's own TTS voice.

Safe to import on any OS: the factory only constructs this class when
``sys.platform == 'darwin'`` and ``osascript`` is on PATH. Every osascript
call is wrapped — a timeout, a non-zero exit (e.g. the Automation TCC denial
``-1743``), or an unparsable volume degrades to a skipped player, never an
exception out of the runtime path.

The Automation consent itself is owned by ``jarvis.platform.permissions``
(the ``automation`` row asks for every player up front); the player list is
shared with it so the scripts and the permission row can never disagree.

CRITICAL script shape: a bare ``tell application ...`` LAUNCHES the app, so
every script guards with ``if application id "..." is running`` INSIDE the
same script and returns ``"-"`` when the player is not running.
