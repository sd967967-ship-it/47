"""Cross-platform microphone capture via sounddevice and PortAudio.

Yields an `AsyncIterator[AudioChunk]` with 16 kHz mono int16 PCM —
the format Whisper expects natively. sounddevice invokes the callback in
the PortAudio thread; the bridge to asyncio runs through a queue.

Why 16 kHz? Whisper consumes 16 kHz natively, so that remains the downstream
contract. The stream requests 16 kHz first; when CoreAudio, ALSA, or a strict
Windows endpoint only accepts its 44.1/48 kHz native rate, capture opens there
and performs a stateful CPU resample before yielding each chunk.

        dropping the oldest frame per arrival and that speech is gone for good —
