        """Stream TTS chunks into a persistent output stream.

        Return ``True`` only when at least one PCM frame was accepted by the
        device stream. A producer that yields no audio, or a stale playback
        rejected by ``should_play``, returns ``False``. Callers use this receipt
        to keep the audible transcript free of text that never reached output.

        ``should_play`` is an optional staleness predicate evaluated after the
        play lock is acquired and before each buffered write. When it returns
        False the playback is dropped silently — the ack preamble uses this so
        it is never voiced once the main answer has started speaking (2026-06-20
        'preamble after the answer' defense-in-depth).

        History — what went wrong before:
            * First version: ``sd.play(blocking=True)`` **per chunk** — each
              20 ms fragment tore down and rebuilt the WASAPI stream completely.
              On 7.1 headsets, short fragments landed on silent channels or
              were lost in the reopen overhead.
            * Second version: accumulate chunks into 1 s / 500 ms / 200 ms
              batches and call ``sd.play(blocking=True)`` per batch. Same
              problem, just less frequent — plus resampler edge ringing at
              every batch boundary, which manifested as a "robotic squeak".

        2026-04-24 — industry standard (Pipecat, LiveKit-Agents, RealtimeTTS,
        sounddevice docs ``play_long_file.py``, Cartesia SDK): **a single,
        permanently open** ``sd.OutputStream`` per response, fed via
        ``stream.write()``. PortAudio blocks internally when its buffer is
        full — no user-space batching needed. Stream reopen only on a sample
        rate change (Gemini 24 kHz → SAPI5 fallback 22 kHz) — an edge case.

        No edge fades on chunks: the stream stays open and chunks are
        appended seamlessly → no discontinuity, no clicks.
