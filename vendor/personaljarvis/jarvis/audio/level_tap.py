"""Process-local, out-of-band level channel for the TTS output amplitude.

Deliberately NOT the EventBus: amplitude updates fire several times per second
and would spam the flight-recorder wildcard subscriber (5 s cap). The
jarvis-bar overlay registers a sink; the audio player publishes the per-flush
RMS. When no sink is registered, publishing is a cheap no-op (the player also
skips the RMS computation entirely via ``has_subscribers()``).

Sync contract: ``stream.write()`` returns when PortAudio ACCEPTS a block, not
when the device makes it audible — the gap is the reported output latency
(hundreds of ms on Bluetooth). A level published at write time therefore leads
the heard voice, and the last ~latency of every sentence plays with no levels
at all (the bars died before the voice finished). ``feed``/``publish`` accept
``delay_s`` so the player can schedule each block's level for the moment it
becomes audible; a single lazy dispatcher thread delivers due levels.
