"""Voice Activity Detection via Silero-VAD with a three-tier fallback chain.

Silero-VAD is a ~2 MB PyTorch model that operates on 16 kHz audio frames of
exactly 512 samples (32 ms) and delivers a speech probability (0.0-1.0) per
frame. Significantly more precise than WebRTC-VAD in noisy/music environments.

The per-frame speech score degrades through three tiers so voice capture never
bricks on a platform without a working native runtime:

  1. Silero ONNX (bundled model on base CPU onnxruntime) — the default.
  2. WebRTC VAD (``webrtcvad``, ships in ``[local-voice]``/``[full]``) when
     the ONNX runtime cannot load or execute.
  3. Portable RMS energy endpointing when neither engine is available.

Used in "endpointing" mode: once a silence phase of `silence_ms` duration is
detected after active speech, the utterance is considered complete and the
pipeline sends the audio to Whisper.
