"""Process-local microphone-loudness channel for overlay equalizers.

The VAD frame loop (which already reads every captured frame for STT) feeds the
raw per-frame RMS via :func:`feed`; a stateful normalizer — adaptive noise
floor + logarithmic dB mapping + attack/release smoothing — turns it into a
reactive 0..1 level. Subscribers (the orb / jarvis-bar, via ``OrbBusBridge``)
render it as live bars that move with your voice.

Why this and not a second mic stream: the old path opened a SECOND
``sd.InputStream`` (on the default device) while the STT pipeline already had
the real mic open — fragile on Windows MME and never actually wired into the
LISTENING transition. Tapping the audio that is ALREADY flowing is what
commercial dictation overlays do, and it's a single stream, no device conflict.

Deliberately NOT the EventBus (same rationale as ``level_tap``): ~30 Hz level
samples would spam the flight-recorder. Zero-cost when nobody subscribes — the
caller gates on :func:`has_subscribers`.
