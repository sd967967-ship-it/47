"""Wait for the audio device enumeration to settle before opening streams.

Permanent fix for the post-reboot audio-device-index drift (BUG-014 class,
2026-05-25 episode). Jarvis autostarts as a tray app the moment the user logs
in — frequently *before* Windows has finished enumerating audio endpoints
(USB headset, monitor audio over DisplayPort, etc.). PortAudio caches the
device table at its first initialization, so a too-early start freezes a
*partial* table for the whole process lifetime:

    Mic-Resolve 'auto-headset' ... — 4 Kandidat(en)      # should be 7
    AudioPlayer nutzt Device: ... (idx=14)               # idx 14 = monitor now
    OutputStream @ 24000Hz failed (Invalid sample rate -9997)

The wake word still fires, but the resolved speaker index points at a
stale/silent endpoint, so the chime and every TTS answer evaporate — the user
hears nothing and concludes "Hey Jarvis doesn't trigger".

``wait_for_stable_audio_devices`` polls the device count, forcing PortAudio to
re-scan on every poll (``_terminate`` + ``_initialize`` — a plain
``query_devices`` would just return the cached partial table), and returns
once the count has been stable for ``stable_window_s`` or ``max_wait_s`` is
hit. Call it once at warm-up, before any stream opens, then re-resolve the
output device. It is a graceful no-op on a headless VPS (sounddevice not
installed) and never raises — audio robustness must never break boot.
