"""Runtime audio-device hot-swap watcher (BUG-102).

PortAudio freezes its device table at initialization, so a process that runs
for hours never sees a headset being plugged in or pulled out. Every layer
above therefore degrades at once: the persistent output stream keeps writing
to a vanished or no-longer-default device (blocking writes, seconds-long
stalls — perceived as "everything lags"), and the microphone watchdog can
only re-open devices from the stale table, so it retries a dead endpoint
forever and can never find the newly arrived one.

This module owns the ONE cross-platform cure, in three parts:

1. **Detection** — poll the out-of-process device probe
   (`jarvis.audio.devices._query_tables_fresh`), which is safe while this
   process holds live streams, and compare a name-based topology signature.
   No OS-specific listener; Windows, macOS, and Linux share the poller.
2. **Coordinated refresh** — when the topology changed: discard every
   registered capture stream and the player's output stream, re-initialize
   PortAudio under the established re-init lock (safe ONLY with no live
   streams — the BUG-058 native-fault hazard), and invalidate every resolve
   cache. The existing self-healers do the rest: the mic stall watchdog
   reopens against the now-fresh table within ~a second, and the player
   reopens lazily on the next playback.
3. **The open guard** — every native stream open holds ``stream_open_guard``
   so no stream can come to life BETWEEN terminate and initialize.

Everything fails open: a failed probe means "no judgment", a failed refresh
leaves the process exactly where it was, and a headless install without
sounddevice never gets past the first probe. Nothing here runs on the boot
critical path (AP-26) — the watcher starts after honest voice readiness.
