"""Completeness self-check ("doctor") — honestly report what is registered and
ready vs. what is advertised but missing.

Motivation (forensic 2026-06-28): a phantom ``jarvis-agent`` harness (advertised in a
tool description + an ``[harness.openclaw].enabled = true`` config block, but never
registered as an entry-point) made Jarvis claim a sub-agent feature was "not
available / not installed" — even though the real sub-agent path (``spawn_worker``
→ Mission-Manager) worked the whole time. The lesson: a fresh download can *look*
complete while a single dead reference makes a working feature appear missing.

This module generalises the defence: it cross-checks every advertised capability
against what is actually registered/installed, and reports honestly:

  * **router tools** — every name in ``ROUTER_TOOLS`` must resolve to a registered
    entry-point (or a known non-entry-point tool). A name that resolves to neither
    is a PHANTOM (the dispatch-to-harness/jarvis-agent class of bug).
  * **harness config** — any harness enabled in ``jarvis.toml`` must be a
    registered harness; an enabled-but-unregistered harness is inert dead config.
  * **sub-agent backend** — the sub-agent code ships in the base install, but the
    *worker* needs an external CLI (``claude`` / ``codex`` / ``agy``). That CLI is a
    separate prerequisite — the real "downloaded but a feature won't run" trap.
  * **brain provider** — Jarvis needs a configured primary brain provider to think.

The result is a flat list of :class:`DoctorFinding`. ``run_doctor`` never raises:
each check is isolated so one failure cannot blind the rest. The CLI wrapper
(``python -m jarvis --doctor``) renders it and exits non-zero on any ``fail``.
