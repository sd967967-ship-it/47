"""Verdict functions over realtime session postmortem counters.

Shared by the two consumers so their verdicts can never drift apart:
``scripts/diag_voice_sessions.py`` (flight-recorder audits after live rounds)
and the codex live-call probe. Pure functions over plain dicts - no bus, no
I/O, no heavy imports; nothing on the boot path imports this module
(AP-26/AP-9).

The input is the payload of one ``RealtimeSessionPostmortem`` event
(``jarvis/core/events.py``): session-lifetime counters, all zero in a healthy
call except ``turns_completed`` - and, until the real ChatGPT-Live terminal
item is confirmed, ``quiescence_boundary_turns``.

#: Spawn budgets. The forensics report treats an overrun as a WARN; the live
#: probe starts at WARN too and flips to FAIL once the latency phase lands
#: (that flip lives in the probe, deliberately not here).
#:
#: The first-audio budget judges ``first_final_to_first_audio_ms`` — the wait
#: the USER experiences between finishing an utterance and hearing the answer.
#: It prefers that metric over ``first_audio_ms``: the latter counts from
#: session start and therefore includes the user's own speaking/listening
#: time, so a healthy codex call (8 311 ms from start, 923 ms after the
#: final, live 2026-08-08) read as a budget breach. When the newer metric is
#: absent — pre-metric recordings, adapters that never stamp it, calls whose
#: audio never followed a user final — the budget falls back to
#: ``first_audio_ms`` so that no recording class escapes it unjudged. The
#: finding names which of the two was judged.

SPAWN_FIRST_AUDIO_BUDGET_MS = 6_000
