"""Render the CONNECTED CLIS system-prompt section.

Design §5.3 (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-10-cli-first-class-capabilities-
design.md): only connected/usable CLIs appear; the section is "" when none
are. Mirrors render_available_skills_section (jarvis/skills/prompt_injection.py):
static per connect/disconnect, cheap to render, defensive against any registry
fault — the system-prompt build must never crash.
