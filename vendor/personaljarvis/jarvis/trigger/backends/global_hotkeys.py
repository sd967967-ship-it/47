"""Windows hotkey backend — the relocated ``global-hotkeys`` logic (AD-7).

This module owns the Windows-only hotkey machinery that used to live inline in
``jarvis/trigger/hotkey.py``. It was **relocated verbatim** — the behaviour is
not refactored — because every line here carries a hard-won BUG fix that the
F1+F2 / F3+F4 shortcuts depend on:

1. ``remove_hotkeys`` is fed combo **strings** (``self._combo_strings``), never
   the ``[combo, on_press, on_release]`` rows — the historical ``__aexit__`` bug
   passed the rows, which raises ``AttributeError`` and left a stale registration
   that bricked every hotkey on the next re-entry.
2. ``register`` pre-removes its own combos before registering, so a stale
   registration left by a crashed previous lifecycle never bricks re-entry with
   "already registered".
3. A module-level refcount starts the single shared checker on the first live
   backend and stops it on the last, so two concurrent triggers (voice pipeline
   + kill-switch) never spawn two checker threads that double-fire every press.
4. A registration failure (missing ``global_hotkeys`` package, or an invalid
   combo) degrades to a no-op instead of crashing the voice pipeline — voice
   still works via wake word / mascot click (cloud-first doctrine + AD-OE6).

``global_hotkeys`` is imported lazily inside ``register`` (HN-7): importing this
module on a host without the package must stay clean.

    Windows reports MORE modifier keys as held than the user physically chose,
    and the library's matcher refuses a chord while any modifier it does not
    itself name is down (``non_allowed_modifiers`` in ``HotkeyChecker.run``).
    Two keys are affected, and both produced a shortcut that saved, displayed
    in the UI, and then never fired once — the "I picked my keys and nothing
    happens" report:

    * **AltGr.** On a German, French, Nordic, Polish, Brazilian (…) layout the
      keyboard driver raises ``VK_CONTROL`` alongside ``VK_MENU`` whenever
      AltGr goes down. A combo the user recorded as ``right_alt+j`` folds to
      ``alt + j``, which does not name Ctrl — so the phantom Ctrl the driver
      injected disqualified the chord on every single press. The shipped
      defaults all happened to spell an explicit ``ctrl``, which is why this
      never showed up in the shortcuts we ourselves ship.
    * **The right Ctrl key.** It raises the generic ``VK_CONTROL`` as well as
      ``VK_RCONTROL``, and ``right_control`` alone names only the specific one.

    They need different repairs, because only one of them is ambiguous:

    * ``right_control`` is a CORRECTION — the generic Ctrl is always up when
      the right Ctrl is down, so ``control + right_control + …`` is simply the
      truthful chord. It still fires exclusively on the right-hand key, since
      the left one never raises ``VK_RCONTROL``.
    * ``alt`` is a VARIANT. By the time a combo reaches this module, every Alt
      spelling has folded onto the one token the library knows, so we can no
      longer tell "the user chose AltGr" from "the user chose the left Alt" —
      and the two produce different physical key states. So both chords are
      armed. They are mutually exclusive by construction: the plain one is
      refused while Ctrl is down, the Ctrl-carrying one requires it, so a press
      matches exactly one of them and a handler never runs twice.

    Returns the primary chord first; anything after it is a compatibility
    variant the caller registers in a second pass, so a chord some other action
    chose EXPLICITLY always wins the registration.
