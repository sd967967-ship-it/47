"""Cross-platform hotkey backends (Wave 1, sub-task 1.4; AD-6/AD-7/AD-8).

The global-hotkey feature follows the uniform AD-6 seam: a ``HotkeyBackend``
``Protocol``, a per-OS implementation, a ``sys.platform`` factory, and a
graceful null-fallback that logs an English message and never raises.

* Windows keeps the battle-tested ``global-hotkeys`` package — its left/right-Alt
  fold, the single-checker refcount, the remove-by-string contract, and the
  pre-remove-on-reentry sequence carry hard-won BUG fixes (the F1+F2-went-dead
  class). That logic was **relocated verbatim** into
  ``jarvis/trigger/backends/global_hotkeys.py`` (AD-7); it is not refactored.
* macOS/Linux (X11) gain ``pynput`` via ``PynputBackend``.
* Wayland (and any box where ``capabilities.has_hotkey`` is ``False``) gets
  ``NoopBackend``: it logs once that global hotkeys are unavailable by OS design
  and otherwise no-ops (AD-8 / AD-OE6 "zero silent drops").

Import-cleanliness contract (HN-7): nothing here — nor in any backend module —
imports a platform-only package (``global_hotkeys`` / ``pynput``) at module
scope. Each backend lazy-imports its dependency inside ``register``/``start``,
so ``import jarvis.trigger.backends`` succeeds on a headless €5-VPS that has
neither package installed.

``HotkeyBinding`` is the existing ``[combo_str, on_press, on_release]`` shape the
``global_hotkeys`` registry uses; the backends consume it unchanged so the
``HotkeyTrigger`` call site stays the single producer of those rows.
