"""macOS hotkey backend via a Quartz ``CGEventTap`` (AD-8, BUG-077).

Why not pynput on macOS: pynput's darwin keyboard listener resolves the
keyboard layout through the HIToolbox Text Services Manager
(``TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource`` / ``TSMGetInputSourceProperty``) from
its own listener thread. Modern macOS asserts that those calls run on the main
dispatch queue and kills the whole process with an uncatchable SIGILL
(``dispatch_assert_queue_fail``) — observed live on macOS 15.7 during the
first Intel-Mac onboarding. The main thread belongs to pywebview, so the only
safe path is to avoid the TSM APIs entirely.

This backend listens with a listen-only ``CGEventTap`` on a dedicated
CFRunLoop thread (event taps are legal off the main thread; the BUG-058 gate
already preflights the Accessibility + Input Monitoring grants that a tap
needs) and matches chords by PHYSICAL key: a fixed ANSI virtual-keycode table
plus the modifier flags word. No layout translation, no TSM, no main-queue
assertion.

Known trade-offs (documented, honest):

* Letter tokens match the ANSI/QWERTY key positions. On a non-ANSI layout the
  chord follows the physical key, not the printed label — the same behavior
  as most native hotkey utilities.
* ``right_control`` matches either Control key (the flags word does not carry
  a portable left/right distinction).
* Mouse buttons (middle and the two side buttons) join the same tap, and only
  when a bound combo actually contains one — the tap never asks for the
  primary click.

The combo vocabulary, edge semantics (``on_press`` fires on the chord-down
transition, ``on_release`` on the chord-up transition — each edge only ever
runs its OWN handler), the permission fail-closed gate, and
``received_any_event()`` mirror ``PynputBackend`` exactly, so the
``HotkeyTrigger`` call site stays platform-agnostic (AD-7).

# Fixed ANSI virtual keycodes (Carbon kVK_ANSI_* / kVK_* constants) -> the
# canonical lowercase tokens `_parse_combo_tokens` produces. Physical-position
# matching keeps this table layout-independent and TSM-free.
#
# COMPLETENESS IS A CONTRACT, not a nicety. The recorder offers a key, the
# validator accepts it, the route saves it and the row renders it as bound —
# and then a key MISSING here simply never enters ``self._held``, so the chord
# can never match. There is no error anywhere in that chain: the user sees a
# saved shortcut that does nothing, on this OS only. That is exactly what
# happened to the whole nav cluster (Home/End/PageUp/PageDown/Insert), the
# entire numpad and F13-F20, every one of which the picker draws as a live,
# clickable cap (``keyboardLayout.ts`` NAV_ROWS, ``codeToKeyToken``'s
# ``Numpad*`` / ``F13+`` branches) while the Windows backend registers them
# fine.
#
# So the rule for this table: it must cover every token
# ``codeToKeyToken`` / ``_NAMED_KEY_TOKENS`` can emit. Adding a bindable cap to
# the picker without adding its keycode here is the same silent-dead-shortcut
# bug again. ``tests/unit/trigger/test_quartz_backend.py`` pins the parity.
