"""No-op hotkey backend for hosts where global hotkeys are unavailable (AD-8).

Returned by ``make_hotkey_backend()`` when ``capabilities.has_hotkey`` is
``False``. Two quite different situations land here and they need different
answers, which is why :func:`explain_unavailable` measures rather than assumes:

* **Wayland** — a process cannot install a global keyboard grab by OS design
  (the compositor owns input routing). Nothing the user installs changes that;
  the fix is a compositor-level shortcut pointing at the CLI.
* **X11 without ``pynput``** — the far more common case, and entirely fixable:
  ``pip install 'personal-jarvis[desktop-linux]'``. It is a separate opt-in
  extra because pynput hard-requires ``evdev``, which is source-only and
  compiles against the kernel headers — pulling it into ``[full]`` would break
  the advertised install on a stock slim image.

Rather than crash or silently do nothing (the "said it worked, nothing
happened" class — AD-OE6), this backend logs one clear English message
explaining the actual situation and then no-ops every call. The voice path is
unaffected: the user leans on the wake word.

The message is emitted at most once per process (a module-level flag), so a
restart-heavy session does not spam the log.
