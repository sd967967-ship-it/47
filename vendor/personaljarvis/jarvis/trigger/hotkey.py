"""Global hotkey trigger with multi-binding support (Call + Hangup).

The hotkey machinery is split behind a cross-platform seam (Wave 1.4, AD-6/AD-8):
``HotkeyTrigger`` is the OS-agnostic orchestrator — it builds the binding rows,
owns the asyncio event queue, and drives the backend lifecycle — while the
per-OS work lives in ``jarvis/trigger/backends/``:

  * Windows keeps the battle-tested ``global-hotkeys`` package
    (``backends/global_hotkeys.py`` — the ``_KEY_MAP``, the single-checker
    refcount, the remove-by-string + pre-remove-on-reentry sequence — relocated
    **verbatim** because each line carries a hard-won BUG fix, AD-7).
  * macOS / Linux-X11 use ``pynput`` (``backends/pynput.py``).
  * Wayland / no-hotkey hosts get ``backends/noop.py`` (logged-once no-op, AD-8).

The backend is chosen by ``make_hotkey_backend()`` from the shared
``jarvis.platform`` capability layer. ``HotkeyTrigger`` never imports a
platform-only package at module scope (HN-7); the lazy import lives inside each
backend's ``register``/``start``.

Default bindings (Phase 1 Jarvis):
  - "call"   -> Ctrl+RightAlt+J  OR  F3+F4
  - "hangup" -> F1+F2

F-keys without a modifier work in global-hotkeys — it registers pure key
combinations, not just modifier combos.

Lifecycle contract (the bug this module kept re-introducing)
------------------------------------------------------------
``global_hotkeys`` is a process-wide *singleton*: ``register_hotkeys`` raises
"already registered" on a duplicate combo, and ``remove_hotkeys`` takes a list
of combo **strings**. The four invariants that keep the shortcuts working
permanently now live inside ``GlobalHotkeysBackend`` (relocated verbatim):

1. teardown removes by combo **string** (never the binding rows);
2. registration pre-removes its own combos so a stale registration left by a
   crashed previous lifecycle never bricks re-entry;
3. a module-level refcount runs a single shared checker so two concurrent
   triggers never double-fire;
4. registration failure (missing package / invalid combo) degrades to a no-op
   instead of crashing the voice pipeline — voice still works via wake word /
   mascot click (cloud-first doctrine + AD-OE6).

``validate_hotkey`` and ``_normalize_combo`` stay importable from this module
for backwards compatibility (the wizard / settings UI import them here).
