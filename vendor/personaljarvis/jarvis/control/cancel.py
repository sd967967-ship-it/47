"""CancelToken + CancelScope + KillSwitch (Phase 5 ADR-0004).

Three components:

1. **CancelToken** — the propagation primitive. `asyncio.Event`-based, plus
   a `reason` field (first-reason-wins) so that later kill events do not
   overwrite an earlier budget-exceeded cancellation.

2. **CancelScope** — async context manager. Registers its token with the
   KillSwitch for the duration of the `async with` block. The scope is the
   only place where long-running operations receive a token — this prevents
   token leaks.

3. **KillSwitch** — aggregator. Holds all active tokens, subscribed to
   `KillRequested` on one or more buses (multi-bus support for the
   two-bus problem described in CLAUDE.md).

Usage:

    async with CancelScope(kill_switch, holder="brain_stream") as token:
        async for chunk in stream:
            if token.is_cancelled():
                break
            yield chunk

    `reason` is frozen after the first `cancel()` call — if a budget overrun
    cancels first and the kill switch fires afterwards, the reason
