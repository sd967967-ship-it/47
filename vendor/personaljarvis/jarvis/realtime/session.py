# of the user's trailing speech (the words after the provider's first
# boundary, which the delegate already consumed). Text input closes the open
# audio turn early; the server's own silence detection then closes it AGAIN

# bridge fires at the class delay — immediately for research / screen /
# mission work, after ``_INSTANT_ACK_GRACE_S`` for short actions and memory
# reads so a fast result stays chatter-free — and speaks a line that names
# the KIND of work (closed pools) or, for actions, a model-composed line that
# names the request's own subject and passes the structural validator.
# ``_DELEGATE_BRIDGE_DELAY_S`` remains the delay for turns the planner cannot

    about provider state, and it does not hold on every path that reaches
    here: the output-language recovery retires the active response before it
    retries, and Gemini Live drops a superseded generation server-side. When
    that assumption breaks, the model is told to answer from a function
    result it no longer holds while being forbidden to call anything — and it
    fills the gap. Live forensic 2026-08-24 10:57:09: ``google_calendar``
    succeeded in 1.2 s and returned real events, its grounded answer was
    blocked at the speech boundary, and the ungrounded retry spoke an
    invented Vercel deployment failure as the answer to "what is on my
    calendar" (the same pattern hit 2 of 3 blocked turns that morning).
    Whenever we still hold the results, they travel WITH the request.

    ``unfinished`` flips this from "just say it" to "finish the job". A turn in
    which a step FAILED or was gated away is not over, and the old unconditional
    "do not call any function, do not repeat the action" was the instruction

    what is due today, research it, look at the plugins, check everything —
    stopped dead after the calendar step failed, because this prompt forbade
    every remaining step). The no-repeat rule still holds for calls that already
    SUCCEEDED: their side effect has happened and must not happen twice.

    ``pending_instructions`` covers the third shape: the only thing that ran is
    a ``run-skill`` load (:func:`_is_skill_handoff_result`). The turn has NOT
    finished and — unlike ``unfinished`` — nothing failed either; the model
    simply stopped after reading the instructions. The "just say it" prompt is
    the wrong one here: it told the model the call "already finished" and to
    use "the function result" as its answer, and on 2026-08-22 18:16 the

        The realtime sibling of ``BrainManager._honest_failure_readback``, and

        deterministic delegate, provider-requested delegate). The maintainer's
        standing rule (2026-08-20): a failure the user hears always names its
        cause, so a follow-up "what was the problem?" is answerable from what
        was actually said instead of invented by the live model.

        Resolution mirrors the Brain path exactly:

        1. ``_speakable_failure_reason`` pulls a human cause out of the result
           (``error`` / ``output.stderr`` / …) — a bare ``exit N``, a numeric
           token or diagnostic noise yields nothing.
        2. The context-aware composer rephrases that ONE fact for this
           situation (bounded flash call, breaker-guarded, AP-11 safe), so the
           line is not a table entry read aloud.
        3. The localized canned phrase is the floor — the ``{reason}`` variant
           when a cause exists, ``generic_key`` when the tool genuinely gave
           none. Never empty, never a hardcoded German string on an en/es turn.

        thinking pause as end-of-turn, so "…the skill system doesn't work
        properly. It doesn't really — you know, recognize the skills" became
        TWO turns. The first dispatched its deterministic delegate; the

        1. an earlier turn's order is still executing without a result
           (``_executing_order_texts``) — a completed order, including one
           awaiting a clarify answer or a confirmation, never captures the
           next turn;
        2. the fragment carries no self-standing order evidence: no command
           verb, no mission, no addressed pane
           (``_SELF_STANDING_ORDER_REASONS``, plus the workspace's own
           ``owns_turn`` sweep) — "and turn on the lights" stays a real
           second order;
        3. every planner reason the fragment DOES carry is already covered
           by the running order's own reasons — "what's on my calendar?"
           spoken while an email check runs brings CURRENT/PRIVATE evidence
           of its own and keeps its dispatch;
        4. the fragment is short (``_CONTINUATION_FRAGMENT_MAX_TOKENS``) — a
           long same-topic follow-up carries new content by sheer length.

        A wrongly refused turn degrades honestly (the deterministic progress
        line now, the trusted result via the late flush); a wrongly allowed
        turn executes a user order TWICE. The asymmetry decides the ties.

        A turn the clarify/confirm mechanism already owns bypasses the guard
        entirely: a bare "yes" answering an ask-tier confirmation plans with
        EMPTY reasons, and an empty set is a subset of every running order's
        reasons — probe 3 would hold vacuously and the confirmation would be
        swallowed (not delayed: dropped, no delegate ever starts for it)
        whenever any UNRELATED order happens to be in flight. The same
