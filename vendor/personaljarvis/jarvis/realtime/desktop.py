# refills on the provider's next burst.

    """Detect deliberate desktop barge-in on the existing microphone stream.

    Desktop realtime stays half-duplex at the provider boundary because raw
    PortAudio capture has no portable acoustic echo cancellation. Dropping the
    microphone entirely while the assistant speaks also makes interruption
    impossible, though. This detector therefore inspects those otherwise-dropped
    16 kHz frames locally with the bundled torch-free Silero ONNX model.

    Detection deliberately matches the conservative classic-pipeline policy:
    a startup grace period, a high speech probability, and sustained speech.
    The returned PCM contains a short pre-speech window plus the confirmed speech
    frames, allowing the caller to cancel output and forward the user's opening
    syllables to any realtime provider without making the provider/model itself
    responsible for desktop echo suppression.

    # echo fed the detector and false barge-ins truncated the answer. AP-27
