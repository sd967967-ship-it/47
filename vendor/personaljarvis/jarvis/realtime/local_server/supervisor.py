"""Lifecycle owner for the managed local realtime server.

The ONE spawn/stop/warm/ownership path. Before this module existed the server
was started in two racing places (the desktop warm worker and the provider's
connect-revive), nothing recorded which process was OURS, nothing could stop
it deliberately, and the Ollama brain model was evicted after five idle
minutes so the first turn after a pause paid a cold model load.

Design decisions (plan 2026-08-08):

- **Ownership is an atomically replaced pidfile** plus an exclusive
  cross-process spawn lock. A thread lock cannot serialize two Jarvis
  processes. Neither file stores environment variables or secrets.
- **Readiness is the model-pool probe**, not a TCP accept. ``/v1/pool`` exists
  only after the speech pipelines are constructed. Port reachability remains
  diagnostic and is NEVER a kill criterion.
- **The server intentionally survives app exit.** Instant next connect is the
  entire point of supervising it; ownership exists for deliberate stop /
  uninstall / reinstall, not for exit cleanup.
- **Spawns are refused, not queued**, whenever spawning cannot help: install
  running, port already served, owned process alive, rate limit, non-loopback
  target. The caller gets the reason as ``"refused:<why>"``.

Everything here is read-only-safe to import (AP-26: no work at import time);
heavy imports stay function-local.

def anchor_brain_load(*, launch_command: str) -> bool:
    """Hold a cold Ollama load open while the voice server boots into it.

    Ollama ties a model load to the requests waiting on it: the moment the
    last client hangs up it logs ``aborting load``, answers 499 and throws
    the partly loaded weights away. The pinned speech-to-speech warm-up gives
    its first completion 20 s and retries six times, so on a host where the
    brain needs longer than that — a 9B model at 32k context on a box whose
    RAM is nearly spent — every attempt kills the very load it is waiting
    for, and the child dies with ``APITimeoutError`` before it ever serves a
    turn. Respawning cannot help: each new generation restarts a load that
    the next timeout aborts again.

    So the spawn path starts one request that simply never hangs up. Its
    prompt is empty, which makes it a pure load: Ollama answers
    ``done_reason: "load"`` the instant the weights are resident. It runs in
    a daemon thread nobody waits for, so :func:`ensure_running` stays as
    quick as it was and a call that cannot be served still fails fast with
    its spoken reason. The child's impatient attempts may still time out; the
    load now survives them, and the next attempt finds a resident model.

    Measured against Ollama on 2026-08-27: three clients aborting at 3 s left
    the load running to completion while one patient client stayed connected.

    Best-effort and idempotent — a non-Ollama brain, an unusable endpoint or
