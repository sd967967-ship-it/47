"""Boot progress, boot statistics and crash forensics for the managed server.

Why this exists (live 2026-08-10 20:16): a deliberate model switch replaced a
healthy idle server, the new generation needed ~65 seconds to load its speech
models, and every call attempt inside that window failed with the static
sentence "try again in about a minute". The card showed the equally static
"Server starting — loading voice models…". Nothing told the user WHICH model
was loading or HOW LONG was actually left, and a silent native crash of the
previous generation (live 2026-08-10 18:41) left zero forensic trace because
the log tail was pure ``/v1/pool`` polling noise.

Three read-only-safe capabilities, all pure functions over explicit inputs so
they are unit-testable without a live server:

- **Stage parsing**: the pinned server logs a stable module prefix per boot
  phase (``speech_to_speech.STT.* Loading``, ``speech_to_speech.TTS.*
  Loading``, …). Matching on the MODULE rather than the model name keeps the
  parse honest across engines and tiers (Parakeet vs Whisper, Qwen3-TTS vs
  others). Lines from earlier generations in the shared append-only log are
  excluded by their timestamps.
- **Boot statistics**: recent completed boot durations (median → honest ETA)
  plus a consecutive readiness-timeout streak, persisted as one small JSON.
  Concurrent writers can race read-modify-write; the cost is one lost sample,
  never corruption (atomic replace).
- **Crash tail**: the last substantive server-log lines with the readiness
  polling noise removed, bounded, for the desktop log when the monitor sees
  the owned process exit.

This module must not import the supervisor (the supervisor imports it); every
path arrives as a parameter.
