"""The one-click install engine for the managed local realtime server.

Turns the hand-built dev-box procedure into a supervised pipeline:
preflight → venv → pinned dependencies → vendored patch → smoke boot →
persist the launch command. Runs in a daemon thread so the REST route
returns immediately; progress is poll-shaped (:func:`snapshot`) and every
failure leaves a resumable state plus a one-sentence reason — never a
half-installed "ready" (readiness itself is :func:`server_status`,
fail-closed).

The smoke boot doubles as the model-download step: the server fetches its
STT/TTS checkpoints into the shared HF cache on first start, so the first
real call never pays that multi-gigabyte surprise.
