Runs BEFORE the first byte downloads and reports, for THIS machine: usable
accelerator memory (dedicated VRAM via the existing hardware detection, or
unified memory on Apple Silicon), free disk against the tier's stated
download volume, the picked tier, and the resolved brain endpoint. Below
the 12 GB floor (AD-10) the report carries the honest blocker and a pointer
to the cloud realtime cards — never a degraded install.

Read-only and side-effect free: probing must not download, create, or start
