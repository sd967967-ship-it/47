"""Brain endpoint resolution for the managed local realtime server (AD-7).

The speech-to-speech server does not think; it forwards each turn to an
OpenAI-Responses-compatible endpoint. Resolution order, capability-gated and
never provider-pinned (AP-21/22):

1. A local Ollama that is actually running and holds a usable model —
   the fully-local path.
2. A configured OpenAI key — honest partial locality ("audio stays on this
   machine, reasoning uses your OpenAI key"). Other cloud families are not
   offered here because the server speaks the Responses API; they join once
   the server (or a proxy) supports their protocols.
3. Neither → a blocker naming the exact fixing actions.

Every probe is short-timeout and read-only; nothing here downloads models.
