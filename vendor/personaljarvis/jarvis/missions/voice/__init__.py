"""Phase-6 voice layer for mission-status readback.

Re-exports of the public API.

Foundation: ADR-0009 §"Open" — voice readback on MissionApproved/Failed
uses the PhrasePicker pattern (anti-repeat window). Tone from
`jarvis/brain/JARVIS_PERSONA.md`: butler register, never "Sir". The
mission-status templates are name-neutral (they carry no hardcoded owner
name) so a fresh clone never speaks the maintainer's name.
