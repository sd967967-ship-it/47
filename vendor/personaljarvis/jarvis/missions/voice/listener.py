"""Bus listener for mission events -> TTS pipeline.

Subscribes to all mission events via `MissionBus.subscribe_all`, filters
for voice-triggered missions (source_actor=`hauptjarvis`), maps event
types onto MissionReadback methods, and calls the TTS synthesize function.

ADR-0009 Decision §"Voice readback only for voice-triggered missions":
UI-triggered missions get a toast (the UI has live updates via WS).

Filtering: looks up the MissionDispatched event from the store (the
Dispatched event is persisted via WAL — no race between mission start and
subscriber wiring). Cached per mission ID so the lookup does not happen
per event.

Audit F-AUDIT-2 (2026-04-29): mission-readback texts now go through
``scrub_for_voice`` before reaching TTS. Without this filter, tool-use
markup, "Sir" address, or engineering jargon reached the user unfiltered
— see ``docs/persona-audit-report.md`` F-AUDIT-2.
