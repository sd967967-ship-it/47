"""MissionAnnouncer — bridge MissionBus -> AnnouncementRequested bus event.

AD-17 (see ``docs/jarvis-agents-bridge.md``): "Notifications via existing
``_on_announcement`` bus" — the Jarvis-Agent bridge pipes mission summaries
through the existing ``AnnouncementRequested`` event into the
``SpeechPipeline``. Advantages over the direct ``tts_speak_fn``
path in ``MissionVoiceListener``:

- Reuse of the finished path in ``pipeline._on_announcement``
  including the ``scrub_for_voice`` filter and barge-in handling
  (``priority="interrupt"`` stops current playback).
- No additional TTS provider dependency in the mission subsystem
  (the speech pipeline bus is sufficient).
- Consistent with sub-Jarvis/skill/vision announcements, which all
  travel through the same event.

Architecture:

- Subscriber on ``MissionBus`` (via ``subscribe_all``) — filters for
  ``hauptjarvis``-source missions (voice-triggered), reads the language
  from the cached ``MissionDispatched`` event and maps event types to
  voice text (``summary_de``/``summary_en`` or static phrases).
- Emits ``AnnouncementRequested`` on the global speech EventBus.
- Errors are logged but never propagated — the voice path must never be
  blocked by a broken mission event.

ADDITIVE component: ``MissionVoiceListener`` (direct-TTS path) remains
unchanged. The bootstrap decides which path is active —
activating both simultaneously results in a double announcement.

    """Mission-Bus -> Speech-Bus bridge via ``AnnouncementRequested``.

    Subscribes on ``start()`` to the ``MissionBus`` and emits on the
    ``speech_bus`` (typically the global ``jarvis.core.bus.EventBus``
    that ``SpeechPipeline._on_announcement`` also subscribes to). Filters
    for voice-triggered missions analogously to ``MissionVoiceListener``.

    Args:
        bus: MissionBus from which mission events are received.
        store: MissionEventStore for looking up ``MissionDispatched``
            metadata (source_actor, language).
        speech_bus: Global EventBus on which ``AnnouncementRequested``
            is published.
        scrub: If ``True`` (default), passes the text through
            ``scrub_for_voice`` BEFORE publishing it as an event.
            ``pipeline._on_announcement`` also scrubs itself — double
            scrubbing is idempotent (pattern-match filter) and therefore safe.
            Set ``scrub=False`` to disable the pre-scrub.
        announce_critic_loop: If True, the announcer also announces
            intermediate iteration states (analogous to the same-named
            flag in ``MissionVoiceListener``). Default False (too chatty).
        priority: ``"normal"`` (default) queues behind current speech.
            ``"interrupt"`` stops ongoing speech — mandatory mode for failures.
