"""WorkerProtocol + SpawnedWorker — structural contracts.

Follows the Phase-0 plugin pattern (`jarvis/core/protocols.py`):
runtime_checkable Protocols instead of inheritance, frozen dataclasses for
data containers. Every `WorkerProtocol` implementation is checked structurally,
not via MRO — this allows third-party workers without importing Jarvis.
