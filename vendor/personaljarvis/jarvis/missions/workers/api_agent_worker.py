"""ApiAgentWorker — an in-process agentic Phase-6 worker for API brains.

The CLI workers (claude / codex / agy) wrap a vendor binary that ships its own
agent loop + file tools. The pure-API providers — **openai**, **openrouter** —
have no such CLI, so picking them as the subagent provider used to fall through
to the Claude worker (they silently ran on Claude). This worker
closes that gap: it drives the selected provider's own chat API
(`jarvis.plugins.brain.*`) in a tool-use loop, writing real files into the git
worktree via :mod:`api_agent_tools`, and emits the same claude-shaped stream the
Kontrollierer + Critic already read (so NO orchestrator change is needed).

Provider-agnostic by design (multi-provider mandate / AP-21): the provider slug
selects the Brain class via a capability-style map; nothing branches on a model
id. A missing API key degrades to a clean error result so the orchestrator's
fallback chain takes over instead of crashing.

Isolation note: unlike the CLI workers the provider loop runs IN the app event
loop. Its local ``RunCommand`` tool uses structured argv and an asynchronous
subprocess, assigns that PID to process-tree containment, reduces the child
environment, and reaps the whole tree on completion, timeout, or cancellation.
Fixed POSIX and Windows gate launchers ensure no model-selected target starts
before process-group/Job assignment; argv remains positional data, never shell
source. File tools are dispatched off the event loop. Cancellation is honored
while a command is active as well as at turn boundaries. This containment is
not a filesystem or code-execution sandbox: workspace scripts retain the
Jarvis user's OS rights and intentionally detached POSIX code can escape a
userspace process group.
