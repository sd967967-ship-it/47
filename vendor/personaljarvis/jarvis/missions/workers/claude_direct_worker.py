"""ClaudeDirectWorker — drives the `claude` CLI directly, bypassing the external `openclaw` CLI.

Live forensics on 2026-05-16 (Verifier-Agent 5/5) proved that the external
``openclaw`` worker CLI (version 2026.5.7) silently ignores
``agents.defaults.cliBackends["claude-cli"].args``
when running ``openclaw agent --local --json --model claude-cli/<model>``.
The injected ``--permission-mode bypassPermissions`` never reaches the
claude binary, so the worker boots in chat-only mode and produces
plausible text ("Habe Datei erstellt") without invoking any write tool.

Empirical proof at /tmp/probe5 and /tmp/probe6 on 2026-05-16:

    echo "<prompt>" | claude --print --permission-mode bypassPermissions \
        --add-dir <cwd>

    -> actual Write tool invocation, actual file on disk

vs the identical request through ``openclaw agent``:

    -> single text block, no tool_use, no file

This worker spawns ``claude`` directly with the right argv and the prompt
on stdin, preserving the WorkerProtocol contract so the Kontrollierer
sees the same ClaudeSystemInit / ClaudeResult events as it does for the
``openclaw``-backed SubJarvisWorker. The provider chain is read from
``[brain.sub_jarvis]`` for parity with SubJarvisWorker — we only act
when the resolved primary provider is ``claude-api``; other providers
fall through to SubJarvisWorker via ``worker_factory`` routing in
``jarvis.missions.init``.

Spawn discipline mirrors GeminiWorker / SubJarvisWorker:

- ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` (no shell, no PTY).
- Win32 ``CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`` creationflags so the per-mission
  Windows Job Object can take ownership.
- Strict ``env=...`` from ``build_worker_env`` (allowlist only).
- ``ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN`` + ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` injected by
  ``_env_builder`` in ``jarvis.missions.init``.

Authentication: current Claude Code can retain its platform-native login while
``--safe-mode`` disables user hooks and plugins. Older releases keep the
isolated-config path and authenticate through an explicitly injected OAuth
token or API key.
