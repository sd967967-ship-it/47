"""The marker that says "this run directory stands on its own".

The Outputs list deliberately hides worktree-slug directories
(``<ts>__<utterance>__<short>``). A worker mission creates two directories —
the temporary worktree it builds in, and the persistent ``mission_<short>``
sibling that carries its identity — and listing both produced the "two agents
for one task" cards reported on 2026-05-26. Hiding the slug directory is the
right call for that case.

It is the wrong call for a directory that has no sibling: a complete run in one
directory, nothing diffed, nothing reviewed, no mission row anywhere (the
2026-08-11 on-demand visualisation wrote such runs; the archive still holds
them). Under the old rule it would be written successfully and then never
appear — indistinguishable, from the user's side, from not being drawn at all.

So the exception is made explicit rather than inferred. A standalone run drops
this small JSON file at its root; the list treats a directory carrying it as a
first-class run and takes the label from it. A real worktree directory never
has one, so the 2026-05-26 behaviour is untouched.

The alternative considered and rejected: naming the directory
``mission_<hex>`` so the existing branch picks it up. That fakes a mission-id
prefix — on a collision the picture would inherit an unrelated mission's status
and error text, and the name would sort by hex instead of by time, which
silently pushes a fresh picture out of the gallery's newest-runs scan window.
