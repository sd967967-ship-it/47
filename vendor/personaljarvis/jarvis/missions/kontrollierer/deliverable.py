"""Deliverable-summary builder for the Kontrollierer's voice readback.

After a mission completes successfully the Kontrollierer publishes a
``MissionApproved`` event whose ``summary_de`` is spoken to the user. For
read-only / informational tasks the worker's plain-text answer is already the
right thing to say. For CODE tasks (tasks that produce file changes) the
previous behaviour was the generic ``"Mission abgeschlossen."`` — the user
heard a confirmation but had no idea WHERE the generated file landed.

Live regression 2026-05-26: two real HTML deliverables existed on disk that
day (``Personal-Jarvis-Landing.html`` 33 KB, ``werbung.html`` 14 KB) and the
user heard about neither. This helper scans the archive directory laid down by
:func:`Kontrollierer._archive_task_artifacts` and produces a TTS-friendly
German sentence that names the file(s) so the user can act on them.

Archive layout the helper reads:

    <mission_dir>/tasks/<task_id[:13]>/artifacts/files/<rel-path>

Output discipline:

* TTS-safe — only bare basenames (``scrub_for_voice`` would mangle slashes).
* ``"Datei"`` is in the scrub whitelist so it survives the voice path.
* Short — 1-3 files inline, more collapses to a count.
* Empty string when there are no archived deliverables (caller falls back to
  the generic phrase).

Pure stdlib, no I/O on the hot path beyond a small ``rglob`` on a known shape.

# 2026-08-23 the answer is always "as an artifact": the Outputs section folded

# not in a directory. Both tables say the same thing; the "delivered" variant
# exists for the caller that also mirrored the files to disk, and it no longer
