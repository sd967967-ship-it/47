"""Single source of truth for "is this archive path a genuine deliverable?".

A worker runs in a fresh ``git worktree``; the Kontrollierer archives its
outputs into ``<mission_dir>/tasks/<id>/artifacts/files/<rel>`` by enumerating
untracked files (``git ls-files --others``) AND — since the 2026-05-27 hardening
audit — gitignored files (``git ls-files --others --ignored``, the "union" that
captures deliverables a worker named with an ignored pattern such as
``output.log`` or anything under ``dist/``). That union is deliberately broad,
so a denylist must keep tool-scratch out of ``artifacts/files/``.

Three layers consume this predicate, so it lives in ONE module to stop the
multi-layer drift bug class (CLAUDE.md / BUG-008):

  * the archive filter — :func:`Kontrollierer._archive_task_artifacts`
    (``orchestrator.py``) — keeps scratch out of the archive at the source;
  * the Outputs-view listing + download/raw/view guards
    (``ui/web/outputs_routes.py``) — hides scratch already on disk from
    pre-fix missions and any other archive path;
  * the user-folder mirror + voice readback
    (``deliverable.py``) — keeps the user's Downloads and the spoken
    "N files saved" count free of scratch.

Live forensic 2026-06-21 (mission_019eeb34-bb67): a browser/QA worker launched
four headless Chrome instances with profiles under
``qa-artifacts/chrome-profile-<hex>/`` and gitignored them (``chrome-profile-*/``).
The ``--ignored`` union re-imported all 199 cache / shader / journal blobs
(68 of them 0-byte) into ``artifacts/files/`` next to the 2 real deliverables;
the Outputs view (cap 200, sort-by-mtime) then buried the real files under the
fresher junk — the user saw "the files aren't shown" and "empty files". The
denylist below recognises browser user-data directories so the union can keep
capturing real ignored deliverables WITHOUT re-importing browser scratch.

Pure stdlib, pure-string, cross-platform (normalises ``\\`` to ``/``). It can
only ever REMOVE recognised scratch from a listing — never a real deliverable,
as long as the patterns stay tight (guarded by ``test_deliverable_paths.py``).
