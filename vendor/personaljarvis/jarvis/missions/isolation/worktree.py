"""Per-task git worktree manager.

ADR-0009 §3 + Research-Doc §E (lines 213-220). Every Phase-6 worker subprocess
gets a fresh working tree as its `cwd` so that parallel edits do not cause
race conditions in the user's working tree.

Path layout (Research-Doc §E point 1):

    <repo_parent>/jarvis-agent-outputs/
      <YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS>__<mission-slug>__<short-uuid>/
        tasks/
          <NN>__<task-slug>/
            workspace/    <- the worker runs here with cwd

`workspace/` is the path created via `git worktree add -b agent/<task-slug>`.
The branch name follows `agent/<NN>-<task-slug>` (no slash in the suffix due
to Windows path lengths).

Constraint: path length ≤ 200 chars (`MAX_PATH=260` minus a safety margin
for files inside the worktree). `create()` raises `ValueError` on violation —
we do not let the worker fall into a path-length trap.

        BUG-LIVE-05: on Windows, `git worktree remove` frequently fails
        with `error: failed to delete '...': Permission denied` right
        after a worker subprocess exits — the Jarvis-Agent worker process
        is gone but a few SQLite WAL / trajectory file handles are still being
        flushed by the OS. A short retry loop (50/100/200 ms) catches
        this transient state without paying the cost of the full
        `shutil.rmtree` fallback. The fallback path is preserved as a
        last resort so cleanup never blocks the mission loop.

        Lean-workspace mode: a lean workspace (created with
        ``create(..., needs_repo=False)``) is a STANDALONE ``git init`` repo,
        not a registered worktree of the host repo. ``git worktree remove``
        would fail on it (``is not a working tree``) AND, worse, could leave a
        stale registration if a path ever collided. So when the workspace's
        ``.git`` is a real directory (lean) rather than the worktree link FILE
        (full mode), we skip git entirely and remove the directory tree
        directly. Plain directory removal leaves nothing for the host repo's
        ``git worktree prune`` to clean up, because the lean repo was never
        registered there in the first place.

          2. Scan the mission outputs root for run-dirs older than
