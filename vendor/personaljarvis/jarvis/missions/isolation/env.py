"""Strict worker environment variable allowlist.

Phase-6 workers run in a subprocess with `env=...` as the complete
environment — NO os.environ inheritance. This prevents secrets
(e.g. AWS_*, GH_*, other API keys from the user's shell) from leaking
into an `openclaw agent`/`codex exec` worker.

Allowlist strategy instead of blocklist (ADR-0009 §3 + Research-Doc §E):
- only explicitly permitted system variables are forwarded,
- API keys are passed explicitly as parameters (no heuristics),
- fixed defaults suppress console color codes, ANSI escape sequences, and
  telemetry traffic (CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1).

The Codex CLI looks up `CODEX_HOME` as its config directory — we pin that
per run to `<run_dir>/.codex/` so every worker has its own cache and there
is no cross-talk between parallel missions.

    *missing* and let `openclaw` handle its own EPERM.

    2026-05-17 (CRIT-3 from audit-team 10): the previous implementation
    materialised a plain *directory* at
    ``<state_dir>/plugin-skills/browser-automation/`` so `openclaw`'s
    first-spawn symlink call would short-circuit on EEXIST. That trade
    looked clean on paper, but live forensics (Audit-2 + Audit-6)
    showed it actually trades EPERM for EINVAL: `openclaw` later does a
    ``readlink()`` against the path, which the kernel rejects with
    EINVAL (Linux/POSIX) or ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION (Win32) because a
    plain directory is not a symbolic link. That EINVAL pulse fired
    ~12×/hour in the live mission log and crashed the same Critic
    spawn we tried to protect.

    Correct fix: try to *create the symlink ourselves* using
    ``os.symlink``. If that succeeds (Developer Mode or admin user),
    `openclaw`'s later ``readlink()`` returns a valid pointer and the
    whole pipeline works. If ``os.symlink`` raises EPERM/EACCES (the
    common case -- ``asInvoker`` user without
    ``SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege``), we simply *do nothing*. The
    path stays nonexistent; `openclaw`'s own symlink call will then
    raise EPERM exactly once and `openclaw`'s bootstrap can fall back to
    its copy-not-symlink branch.

    The only thing we deliberately do NOT do anymore is materialise a
    directory at the target -- that was the EINVAL trap.

    Idempotent and best-effort: every failure path is logged at INFO
