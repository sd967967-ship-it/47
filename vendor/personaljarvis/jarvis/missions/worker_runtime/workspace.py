"""Workspace isolator per Jarvis-Agent mission (AD-23, AP-OC15).

Background (Wave-1-Spike B-9):
    The external `openclaw` worker CLI automatically injects ~35.4k chars of
    system prompt from `~/.openclaw/workspace/` at the start of every
    `agent --local` run:

        AGENTS.md   7774 chars  <- anti-pattern docs, not Personal-Jarvis AGENTS
        SOUL.md     1797 chars  <- default persona ("I am OpenClaw, ...")
        TOOLS.md     910 chars  <- `openclaw` tool docs (irrelevant for us)
        IDENTITY.md  693 chars  <- `openclaw` self-reference
        USER.md       (variable) <- `openclaw` user profile

    Risks without override:
        1. Persona drift: SOUL.md/IDENTITY.md overwrites the Personal-Jarvis
           persona mandate from jarvis/brain/persona.py.
        2. Voice readback leak: "I am OpenClaw" self-reference could slip
           through scrub_for_voice (filter coverage not guaranteed).
        3. Cross-mission leak: without `MISSION_STATE_DIR` all spawns share
           the same `~/.openclaw/workspace/`.

Mitigation (AD-23):
    - Bridge sets `MISSION_STATE_DIR=<mission_dir>/openclaw_state`.
    - This helper writes a minimal Personal-Jarvis profile (5 stub files)
      under `<state_dir>/workspace/`.
    - Bridge audits `meta.systemPromptReport.injectedWorkspaceFiles[]` after
      the spawn and raises an alert if unexpected files appear.

Pure file I/O, no subprocess calls.

    This file is injected by the external `openclaw` CLI into the worker's system prompt at
    spawn time (Welle-1-Spike B-9 verified). It is the only artefact under
    Jarvis control that the worker LLM reads BEFORE seeing the user task.

    Live repro 2026-05-15 (mission_019e2d35, gemini-3.1-pro-preview): the
    worker burned 24-26k tokens, claimed `"Habe Datei erfolgreich erstellt"`  # i18n-allow (quotes the worker LLM's actual reply text)
    (English: "Have successfully created file") in its reply text, but
    never invoked the `Write`/`file_write` tool —
    `_capture_diff(worktree)` returned empty. This is a well-known
    Gemini-3.1-Pro-Preview tool-skip pattern (`openclaw` issue #3344). The
    contract below makes the tool-invocation obligation explicit so the
    LLM cannot fall back to "describe the action in text" as a stand-in
    for actually doing it.

    Critic enforces empty-diff → revise deterministically (`runner.py:165`
    pre-gate, Fix A 2026-05-15). After 3 such revises the mission ends
    as `critic_loop_exhausted`. The contract here is the upstream
    counter-measure: tell the worker explicitly that filesystem mutation
    is required, not optional, and that text claims do not count.

#
# Audit-6 (BUG-021 recurrence) showed that ``prepare_workspace`` is dead
# code under the ClaudeDirectWorker path: claude --print does not look at
# MISSION_STATE_DIR/workspace/AGENTS.md, it reads CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md
# from the worktree cwd it is given via --add-dir. Without the contract
# in scope, the worker happily produces "Habe Datei erstellt" without
# invoking a Write tool (the exact BUG-021 failure mode, dormant since
# 2026-05-16 when we switched the default worker to claude-direct).
#
# Fix: materialise AGENTS.md directly in the worktree root, and add it
# to the per-worktree ``.git/info/exclude`` so it never shows up in the
# diff that Kontrollierer captures for the Critic. The Critic must see
# only what the worker actually changed; the contract itself is runtime
# infrastructure, not part of the worker's output.
