"""Personal-Jarvis provider-slug to worker-harness provider-slug mapping.

Pure data module without IO — subprocess spawn mechanics live in
`jarvis/missions/workers/provider_chain.py`.

Bridge mechanics (summary for future readers):
    1. cfg.brain.primary  -> jarvis provider slug (e.g. "gemini")
    2. to_worker_slug() -> worker harness slug (e.g. "google")
    3. cfg.brain.providers.<jarvis>.deep_model -> model ID (e.g. "gemini-3.1-pro-preview")
    4. CLI argument: --model "google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview"
    5. env_vars_for() -> ENV vars that the worker harness reads at spawn time (primary +
       fallback; both are set so that harness provider drift does not break auth).

Jarvis-Agent credentials use dedicated keyring slots. The supervisor resolves
the scoped slot and translates it to the standard provider ENV name only at the
worker boundary. Generic Brain credentials remain a compatibility fallback for
upgraded installations; Realtime-only credentials are never candidates.
