"""Startup recovery for the Phase-6 mission subsystem.

If the orchestrator crashed while missions were in non-terminal states
(PENDING, RUNNING, CRITIQUING, LOOPING), they must eventually be marked as
FAILED('crash_recovery'). Otherwise they hang in the DB forever and no
subscriber ever receives a terminal state.

Pattern from ADR-0009 §"Decision §4 + Risk #9": scan list_non_terminal_missions,
emit MissionStateChanged + MissionFailed per stale mission, persist + publish.
Idempotent — a second recovery iteration finds no more stale missions.

ACTIVITY-AWARE (live forensic 2026-05-31, missions 019e6fea / 019e7095):
the original sweep marked EVERY non-terminal mission FAILED unconditionally.
When a SECOND instance booted against the shared `missions.db` (e.g. a
`--headless` launch that never set JARVIS_PRIMARY_INSTANCE, so the recover-flag
guard defaulted it to primary), its sweep killed the FIRST instance's actively
running missions — which then ran on to MissionApproved, leaving a poisoned
FAILED header. That is the "Mission failed although it worked, ~1h later,
randomly" bug. Two guards make the sweep safe regardless of which instance runs
it (so it is robust to headless double-launch, autostart races, and the
cloud-first headless-VPS case alike):

1. RECONCILE — if a non-terminal mission's event log already carries a terminal
   event (MissionApproved/Failed/Cancelled/TimedOut), align the header to that
   real state. No new failure is emitted, so a succeeded-but-unfinalized mission
   is never reported as failed, and an already-poisoned mission is repaired.
2. ACTIVE-GUARD — a mission whose last event is younger than ``stale_after_ms``
   is presumed owned by a LIVE orchestrator and is SKIPPED. Only genuinely
   stale, orphaned missions are swept to FAILED('crash_recovery').

# active-guarded sweep on a timer: once an orphaned mission crosses the existing

    ``startup_recover`` runs once at boot and, thanks to the active-guard, SKIPS
    any mission that still looks live (recent event/heartbeat). That is correct
    at boot — a parallel ``--no-lock`` instance may genuinely own it — but it
    means a mission whose owner dies *after* boot is never re-checked and stays
    non-terminal forever (mission 019eb25c, 2026-06-10). This loop closes that
    gap: every ``interval_s`` it re-runs the SAME conservative sweep, so once an
    orphan's last activity crosses ``stale_after_ms`` the next tick finalizes it.

    Safety:
        * Each tick's :func:`startup_recover` call is wrapped — any exception is
          caught and logged, never allowed to kill the loop (mirrors the
          EventBus ``_safe_dispatch`` philosophy, AP-18). A transient DB error on
          one tick must not stop all future sweeps.
        * The loop logs at most a debug-level line per no-op tick and stays quiet
          otherwise; it only logs at info level when a tick actually recovered
          one or more missions.
        * Cancellation (``asyncio.CancelledError``) exits cleanly — the loop is
