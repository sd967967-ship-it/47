"""ToolExecutor: orchestrates risk-eval → plausibility → approval → execute → event log.

The only authorized entry point for tool calls. Calling `Tool.execute()`
directly bypasses safety — that is a bug.

Phase 4 (persona mandate): a plausibility check runs before every approval
decision. If the voice pipeline has registered a ``plausibility_context_fn``,
the executor fetches transcript confidence + wake age and decides whether
``ask``/``monitor`` tools need an extra confirmation (see
``jarvis.brain.plausibility``).
