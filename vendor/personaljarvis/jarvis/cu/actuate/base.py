"""Actuator protocol, landed-position verification, backend selection.

Design contract (CU v2): a silent miss is worse than a loud failure. Every
pointer action therefore goes through :func:`verified_move` — position the
cursor, read it back, and refuse to press the button when the cursor did not
land within :data:`LANDING_TOLERANCE` of the target. A DPI mis-mapping or a
clamped multi-monitor move then surfaces as a diagnosable error string
instead of a click on the wrong control.

Backend selection is a runtime capability probe (never an OS allowlist in
callers): Windows -> native SendInput; macOS / Linux-X11 -> pynput (pyautogui
fallback); Wayland / headless -> :class:`ActuationUnavailable` with an
actionable message.
