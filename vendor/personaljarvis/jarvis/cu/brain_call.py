"""Provider-agnostic vision-brain dispatch for Computer-Use v2.

A lean re-implementation of the legacy engine's battle-tested dispatch
behavior, without importing the monolith:

* FakeBrain test shim (``manager.complete_text``) first.
* Candidate order = ``BrainManager._build_fallback_chain("fast")`` with the
  per-provider CU model override — never a provider name hardcode (AP-21/22).
* Health/vision filtering via :class:`ComputerUsePlannerSelector` (skips
  dead/cooldown/blind providers) plus the stale-dead-flag last resort.
* The prompt is built PER CANDIDATE via a callback, because the coordinate
  convention (0-1000 grid vs image pixels) depends on which provider the
  call actually lands on — a mid-mission cross-family fallback must not be
  parsed in the wrong space.

Raises :class:`CUNoVisionProviderError` when the whole chain is exhausted —
the engine maps it to exit 3 ("check your keys/credit"), keeping the honest
credential readback the legacy engine had.
