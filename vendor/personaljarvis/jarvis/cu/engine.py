"""Computer-Use v2 engine — the perceive->act->verify mission loop.

Drop-in replacement for the legacy ``run_cu_loop`` (same signature, same
HarnessResult stream, same exit-code + readback contract), selected via
``[computer_use].engine = "v2"``. The structural differences to the legacy
monolith:

* **One frame, one mapper.** Every coordinate resolves through the
  CoordinateMapper of the frame the model actually saw; the coordinate
  convention is resolved per provider (``conventions.py``).
* **UI-idle capture.** A frame is only handed to the model once the screen
  stopped changing (bounded), replacing fixed settle sleeps.
* **Closed verification loop.** Every state-changing action is effect-checked
  (pre/post monitor grab: local crop + global diff; type read-back via the
  accessibility tree). A failed check fails the action, truncates the rest
  of the batch and forces re-perception — never silent continuation.
* **Idempotency ledger.** An action that already executed against a visually
  identical frame is refused deterministically (the double-type/double-click
  killer), replacing the legacy guard zoo.
* **One pointer action per batch.** Coordinates are only trusted for the
  first pointer action after a perception; later pointer actions in the same
  batch would act on a stale frame and are refused.

Exit codes (kept stable for the voice/UI layer): 0 done, 1 observe failure,
2 parse/confused, 3 no vision provider, 4 budget, 5 gave up / no progress,
8 tool failure, 124 timeout (outer harness), 130 cancelled.

Simplifications vs. legacy (documented, revisit when needed): no zoom-refine
LLM round (downscaled frames + effect-check retry replace it), no elevation-
prompt wait, no interactive human-handoff wait (a handoff screen fails fast
with a speakable reason instead).
