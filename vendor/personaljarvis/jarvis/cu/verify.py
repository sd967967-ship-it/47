"""Pre/post verification for Computer-Use v2 actions.

Ports the legacy engine's PROVEN deterministic read-back helpers (type
read-back, focus confirmation, field-value hints, human-handoff detection —
all pure accessibility-tree inspections, no LLM calls) and adds the v2
effect-check primitives:

* :func:`regions_equal` — raw pre/post pixel comparison around an action
  point ("did anything near the click visibly react?").
* :func:`screen_drifted` — has the screen visibly changed since the frame
  the model decided on? If yes, acting on stale coordinates is a guess —
  the loop re-perceives instead (pre-execution UI-state verification).

CRITICAL sourcing rule (documented trap): UIA nodes/values come ONLY from
the dedicated tree-source enumeration below — never from a screenshot-mode
``observation.nodes``, which is always empty in the CU path.
