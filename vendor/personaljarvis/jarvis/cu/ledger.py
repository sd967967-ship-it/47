"""Idempotency ledger — the ONE principle behind "never act twice blindly".

The legacy engine grew a zoo of special-case guards (toggle-thrash points,
last-typed-text, per-app launch counters, stall nudges) that interacted in
surprising ways. CU v2 replaces them with a single rule:

    An action that already executed against a visually identical screen is
    refused deterministically.

"Visually identical" is keyed by the frame's PERCEPTUAL identity (the
grayscale thumbnail compared via ``jarvis.cu.capture.thumbs_similar``, noise-
tolerant) — if the screen genuinely changed since the first execution, the
same action is legitimate again (navigating a list clicks different rows on
*different* frames; retyping a search on a *changed* page is fine). Clicking
twice on the same unchanged frame, typing the same URL again into an
unchanged address bar, or launching the same app while the screen never
moved is exactly the double-action bug class and is blocked regardless of
what the model asks for.

``wait`` is exempt (waiting twice is harmless and sometimes right).

``scroll`` is exempt too (2026-07-18): the engine effect-checks every scroll
— a wheel event the app visibly ignored FAILS the action with feedback, so a
scroll can no longer "run blindly". And a repeated scroll on a similar-looking
frame is often legitimate forward progress (long uniform pages); the old
direction-only key (``scroll@down``) refused every retry silently, which
starved the no-progress guard into an opaque early abort (live Gmail run,
07:47: unsubscribe hunt died after one swallowed wheel event).
