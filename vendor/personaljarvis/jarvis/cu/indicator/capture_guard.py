"""Keep the indicator out of Computer-Use's own perception frames.

On Windows the sidecar windows carry ``WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`` as a fast
path. Every OS also registers this correctness backstop: it hides the border
for the split second of each frame grab (blank → grab → unblank). This covers
Windows hosts where display affinity is unsupported or silently rejected.

Fail-open by design: a missing hook, a dead sidecar, or a late ack must
NEVER delay or break the grab beyond the small ack timeout — a border
pixel in one frame is a cosmetic defect, a broken perception loop kills
the mission.
