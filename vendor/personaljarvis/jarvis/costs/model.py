"""The normalised line item every cost source is reduced to.

Two vocabularies carry the whole section:

**Surface** — which part of the app spent it (voice, agent chat, a mission).
**Role** — what the model was doing in that surface. A realtime voice turn
that delegates one tool call to a text model spends on TWO roles at once, and
they bill at wildly different rates (Live-API audio tokens run 4-40x the text
rate of the same family), so a report that only knows "provider" hides the
single most useful answer: *what kind of work* the money went to.

Pricing honesty is the other half. A recorded ``cost_usd`` of 0.0 means one of
four very different things, and the UI must be able to tell them apart:

``recorded``  the source priced the call itself (realtime audio rates included)
``derived``   the source stored 0.0, we re-priced it from the rate tables
``free``      a local engine or an explicitly free model — 0.0 is the truth
``unknown``   tokens were spent, no rate exists anywhere — 0.0 is a GAP
``subscription`` a seat paid monthly — the amount is what the same work
              would have cost through the API, not money that moved

Only ``unknown`` is a hole in the accounting, and it is reported as tokens,
never quietly folded into the total as if it were free. ``subscription`` is
the opposite kind of honesty: the number is real arithmetic on real tokens,
but no invoice carries it, so it is named rather than mixed in silently.
