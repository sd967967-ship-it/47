"""Incremental index of token usage in the vendor coding-CLI session logs.

The cost read model (:mod:`jarvis.costs.sources`) answers a request in
milliseconds because every store it reads is a small SQLite file. The coding
CLIs are the opposite: they append JSONL transcripts that on a working machine
reach several gigabytes (measured here: 659 MB of Claude Code across 948 files,
9.5 GB of Codex across 2466 files, one single rollout of 484 MB). Parsing that
per request is impossible, so this module reads each file ONCE, remembers the
byte offset it got to, and writes one small row per model call into its own
database. Callers then query rows, never logs.

Nothing here prices anything — that stays with the read model. This module only
answers *how many tokens, when, by which agent and model*.

What each source looks like — MEASURED on a live install, not taken from
documentation:

**Claude Code** — ``<config>/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl``, and the
subagents that session spawned under
``<config>/projects/<slug>/<session>/subagents/**/*.jsonl`` (a plain
``agent-<id>.jsonl`` for the Agent tool, ``workflows/<run>/agent-<id>.jsonl``
for a workflow). A subagent file is the same record shape, stamped with the
PARENT's ``sessionId``, so its spend files under the conversation that asked
for it. Those files were never read until 2026-08-27 — on the machine this was
measured on they held 14 466 of 68 937 responses, one fifth of every Claude
Code call. The records that carry usage have ``type == "assistant"`` and hold
it at ``message.usage``, with the thinking count nested one level deeper in
``usage.output_tokens_details``.

*The identity of such a record is NOT its ``uuid``.* One API response is
written as one line PER content block, each line getting its own ``uuid`` while
repeating the SAME ``message.usage``. On a sampled transcript that was 64
assistant lines for 31 responses — deduplicating by ``uuid`` would have
reported roughly twice the tokens that were actually billed. The identity used
here is ``message.id`` (the ``msg_...`` the API assigns), falling back to
``requestId`` and only then to ``uuid``. Because that id is unique everywhere,
the same response copied into a resumed or forked transcript is also counted
once, which is the correct answer.

**Codex** — ``<home>/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-<iso>-<uuid>.jsonl``.
Usage arrives as ``event_msg`` records with ``payload.type == "token_count"``.
Only ``payload.info.last_token_usage`` is read: its sibling
``total_token_usage`` is CUMULATIVE, so summing it would multiply the real
number by the turn count. ``info`` is ``null`` on the records a session emits
before its first model call — those contribute nothing. The model is not on the
usage record; it is on ``turn_context`` records and is carried forward within
the file (and across a resumed scan, which is why the resume row stores it).
The session id comes from the ``session_meta`` record, or from the filename.

Two Codex conventions differ from Claude's and both cost real money when
missed (a 37 000 USD "bill" on one machine, 2026-08-24):

* ``input_tokens`` INCLUDES ``cached_input_tokens`` — the OpenAI usage
  object reports cache hits as a breakdown of the input count, whereas
  Anthropic reports them as a separate field. The cached share is subtracted
  so ``tokens_in`` means "uncached input" for every agent alike.
* A forked or resumed thread starts a NEW rollout file and replays its whole
  parent history into it as fresh ``token_count`` records — thousands of
  them, stamped with the moment of the fork. Byte offsets are new, so they
  cannot identify a turn across files. The running total can: within one
  lineage it is monotonic and unique per real model call, and the lineage is
  what ``session_meta.session_id`` names (a fork keeps its parent's
  ``session_id`` and gets its own ``id``). The dedup key is therefore
  ``session_id + total_token_usage`` and the replay collapses onto the
  original. A replayed row can arrive BEFORE the parent's ``turn_context``
  and so carry no model; the insert lets a later row with a model fill it in.

**agy** — ``<root>/sessions/**/wire.jsonl``. Two generations ship under one
binary and keep separate roots (``~/.kimi``, ``~/.kimi-code``); both are read,
since a machine can carry both histories. The usage record shape is taken from
real transcripts of the LEGACY layout, the only one on this machine that holds
finished turns::

    {"timestamp": 1770293705.85, "message": {"type": "StatusUpdate", "payload":
      {"token_usage": {"input_other": 1384, "output": 184,
                       "input_cache_read": 4864, "input_cache_creation": 0}}}}

Those counters are per model call, not cumulative (verified: they rise and fall
across a session). The eleven current-layout transcripts available here contain
only the setup prefix a session writes when it opens, so that generation's
finished-turn shape is UNVERIFIED: its files are scanned with the same reader
and contribute nothing unless they carry the same records. Nothing is guessed.
agy records no model id anywhere in the transcript, so :attr:`CliTurn.model`
stays empty for it.

Design rules this module holds itself to:

* **Never raises.** A missing root, an unreadable file, a corrupt line, a
  locked database — each degrades to "contributed nothing" and is logged.
  A fresh machine with none of these directories returns empty results.
* **Incremental.** A file is re-opened at its stored offset when it grew, and
  re-read from zero only when it SHRANK (rotated or rewritten), whose rows are
  dropped first. An offset is only ever stored at a line boundary.
* **Durable.** The index is a ledger, not a cache of the transcripts. A turn
  that was indexed stays indexed when its transcript is deleted — Claude Code
  removes sessions after ``cleanupPeriodDays`` (25 on the machine this was
  found on), and the money those sessions cost did not come back with them.
  Until 2026-08-27 a vanished file took its rows with it and the lifetime
  total shrank a little every night. Likewise a reader whose accounting rule
  changes never drops the table: every transcript still on disk is re-read
  and its rows are corrected in place, so the section never shows a half-
  built index as if it were the whole bill (the previous rebuild dropped
  everything first and reported $8 000 of a $13 600 month for the hours it
  took to catch up).
* **Bounded.** :func:`refresh` stops when its deadline is spent, commits what
  it has and says ``complete=False``. Files are taken newest-modified first and
  no single file may take more than :data:`_FILE_BYTE_BUDGET` per run, so one
  half-gigabyte rollout cannot starve the rest.
* **Cheap first.** Every line is tested for a substring on the raw bytes before
  ``json.loads`` is considered.
