"""Context-aware spoken readbacks for the deterministic action paths.

The maintainer's standing requirement: Jarvis must not read fixed "stock"
sentences out of a lookup table for its status / outcome / acknowledgement
replies. Those replies should sound like Jarvis reacting to *this* situation,
not like a vending machine. This module is the engine that delivers that, while
honoring the three hard constraints that made the static tables exist in the
first place:

1. **Latency (AP-11 / SLO):** generation is one bounded flash-LLM call
   (``[ack_brain].timeout_ms``, breaker-guarded — the exact category the
   pre-thinking ack and the spawn announcer already use). It never runs inside
   ``scrub_for_voice`` and always has an instant deterministic fallback, so a
   slow/dead provider costs at most one timeout before the canned line is spoken.
2. **Honesty (ADR-0009 / AD-OE6):** the composer is handed the deterministic
   ground truth (``facts``) and is told to *rephrase only that, inventing
   nothing*. A digit-fabrication guard plus, for ``honesty_bound`` situations, a
   content-overlap guard reject any output that adds facts not present in the
   input. It NEVER raises and NEVER returns an empty string — on any failure it
   returns the supplied canned fallback, so a status line is never silently
   dropped.
3. **Language (Runtime Output Language doctrine):** the turn's resolved language
   (de/en/es) is passed in and the model is told to answer in it; a de/en
   mismatch is rejected to the canned fallback, and the canned fallback itself
   already covers all three languages.

Design mirrors :class:`jarvis.brain.ack_brain.spawn_announcement.SpawnAnnouncementComposer`
(brain candidate → flash compose → validate → deterministic fallback, one
failover level, never-raise) so the two flash consumers behave identically and
share the provider/breaker wiring built by ``jarvis.brain.factory``.

This module holds NO German/Spanish phrase pool of its own: the deterministic
fallback is the EXISTING canned table, supplied by the call site as a
``canned`` callable. The persona frame here is an English meta-prompt that
instructs the model to answer in the user's language, so de/en/es all generate
natively (it is a NEW prompt, not the locked 2026-05-11 flash-brain persona).
