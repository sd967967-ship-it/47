"""Context registry for the ComputerUseHarness (ADR-0008).

Because harness plugins are instantiated without arguments via `entry_points`,
but the Computer-Use loop needs access to VisionEngine, BrainManager,
ToolExecutor, etc., we maintain a process-wide context singleton.

The app calls `set_computer_use_context(ctx)` once at startup; the harness
retrieves it in `invoke()`. An unset context raises a clear error message
rather than silently degrading.

This is a deliberate pragmatic solution for the plugin architecture — the
rest of the system uses dependency injection.
