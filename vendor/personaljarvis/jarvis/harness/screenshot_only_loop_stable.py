"""Screenshot-Only Computer-Use Loop (POAV simplification, 2026-05-26).

One screenshot -> one LLM call -> ONE OR MORE actions per step (the latter
when the model returns a batch; see below). No Set-of-Marks, no UIA tree,
no replan budget, no verify-after-step pass.

Action schema (the model returns either a single object OR a list of
objects per turn -- the executor handles both):

    {"action": "click_element", "name": "<UIA label>"}   UIA-grounded click
    {"action": "click",         "x": <int>, "y": <int>,
                                "target": "<element>"}   0-1000 normalized coords
                                                         (target arms the zoom-
                                                         refinement pass)
    {"action": "type",          "text": "<string>"}      type into focused field
    {"action": "open_app",      "name": "<app name>"}    launch an app by name
    {"action": "wait",          "ms": <int 0-10000>}     in-loop pause, no LLM
    {"action": "done"}                                   user goal achieved
    {"action": "fail",          "reason": "<string>"}    impossible from here

The system prompt instructs the model to ALWAYS prefer click_element over
raw click when the target has a readable label, because Vision LLMs cannot
reliably ground raw pixel coordinates from a screenshot (live evidence
2026-05-27: Gemini Flash guessed (646, 984) / (36, 262) for the Calc "7"
button across 6 attempts and never landed it).

A LIST of actions is a "batch" / plan-then-execute step. The whole list
runs under ONE screenshot -- no fresh observe between items -- so e.g.
``[click, wait, click]`` is a single iteration. Used to amortise the
~1.7 s LLM round-trip across multiple actions when the current screenshot
shows every target. Max 6 actions per batch (truncated otherwise).

Termination paths:
    - "done"            -> exit_code 0
    - "fail"            -> exit_code 5
    - parse error       -> exit_code 2
    - step budget       -> exit_code 4
    - tool failure      -> exit_code 8
    - observe failure   -> exit_code 1
    - elevation unmet   -> exit_code 9   (UAC/privilege prompt never confirmed)
    - any timeout       -> exit_code 124
    - cancel token      -> exit_code 130

The Brain is dispatched directly through the active provider's fast-tier
brain (Gemini Flash when configured) -- not through the Router gate -- so
the screenshot is the sole grounding signal. The model NEVER receives a
UIA node listing or a Set-of-Marks legend.

    "edge, 500 = vertical center, 1000 = BOTTOM edge. Origin top-left.\n"

    "bottom toolbar / media player bar (e.g. Spotify's play/pause controls) "
    "sits near y=950-985. A top menu bar sits near y=15-40. The far-right "
    "edge is x~985.\n"
    "* Aim for the CENTER of the target element. Read its position from the "
    "image as a fraction of the screen and express it on the 0-1000 grid.\n\n"
    "GROUNDING POLICY (read carefully -- this is the #1 source of wrong clicks):\n"
    "* PREFER ``click_element`` (by accessibility NAME) for ANY control that "
    "has a readable label: buttons, menu items, list rows, tabs, checkboxes, "
    "text fields. Native apps -- Calculator, Notepad, Settings, File Explorer, "
    "Office, dialogs -- expose clean accessibility names. When an "
    "'AVAILABLE CONTROLS' list is given below, use one of those EXACT names. "
    "This is DETERMINISTIC: it clicks the control's true center, immune to "
    "resolution, window size, and monitor offset -- pixel-guessing a small "
    "button inside a big screen does NOT work.\n"
    "* Use the control's German label or its name exactly as listed -- e.g. "
    "the Calculator keys are \"Acht\" (8), \"Sieben\" (7), \"Neun\" (9), "
    "\"Multiplizieren mit\" (x), \"Plus\" (+), \"Minus\" (-), "
    "\"Dividieren durch\" (/), \"Gleich\" (=). NEVER pass a bare symbol like "
    "\"8\", \"x\" or \"+\" to click_element -- \"x\" matches the window's "
    "Maximize button, not multiply.\n"
    "* Use pixel ``click`` (x, y) ONLY when the target has NO usable label -- "
    "media scrubbers / transport bars (Spotify play/pause), game canvases, "
    "video surfaces, custom-painted UIs -- OR when click_element reports the "
    "label is genuinely absent from the available controls.\n"
    "* ALWAYS include \"target\" on a pixel click (e.g. \"skip forward "
    "button\"): a zoomed verification pass uses it to re-locate the exact "
    "element and silently corrects your coordinates before clicking.\n"
    "* To type into a field: first focus it (click_element the field, or "
    "click it), then ``type``. Never type blindly into an unfocused screen. "
    "If the field already holds text you must REPLACE (an address bar with a "
    "URL, a search box with an old query), set \"clear_first\": true on the "
    "type action -- it selects all and overwrites, so you never get a mixed "
    "value like google.comgmail.com.\n"
    "* LITERAL DICTATION: when the goal tells you to type, say, write, or enter "
    "specific words (e.g. 'type hello hello hello', 'say X', 'write Y'), the "
    "``type`` action's text MUST be exactly those words -- copy them verbatim. "
    "Do NOT add, wrap, or transform them into a shell command or any prefix; in "
    "particular NEVER prepend 'echo' or surround them with quotes. Only compute "
    "different text when the goal explicitly asks you to (e.g. 'search for X' -> "
    "type the query X; 'go to gmail' -> type the URL).\n"
    "* If click_element misses, it returns the available labels -- pick the "
    "closest real one; do NOT fall back to blind pixel-guessing on a small "
    "control.\n"
    "* If the target (a chat, a list row, a button, page content) is NOT "
    "visible in the current screenshot, use ``scroll`` (direction up/down/"
    "left/right) to bring it into view, then re-observe -- do NOT guess a "
    "click on something you cannot see.\n\n"
    "BATCHING (LATENCY matters):\n"
    "* You MAY return a LIST of up to 6 actions when the current screenshot "
    "already shows EVERY target the batch will touch. One LLM call with a "
    "batch is much faster than one call per action. Insert "
    "{\"action\": \"wait\", \"ms\": N} between actions that need the UI to "
    "settle.\n"
    "* Do NOT batch past an unrevealed UI: after ``open_app`` or any action "
    "that changes the screen, STOP the batch and let the next screenshot "
    "show the result. When unsure, return a single action.\n"
    "* EXAMPLE BATCH -- a browser already shows a filled address bar; go to a "
    "new site in ONE call (the bar, its current value, and Enter are all known "
    "from the current screenshot, so no fresh screenshot is needed between):\n"
    "      [{\"action\": \"type\", \"text\": \"example.com\", "
    "\"clear_first\": true},\n"
    "       {\"action\": \"key\", \"key\": \"enter\"}]\n"
    "  That is 1 LLM call instead of 3. Default to batching whenever every "
    "target is already visible -- it is the single biggest latency win.\n\n"
    "APP LAUNCH:\n"
    "* Use ``open_app`` for launch goals (\"open Spotify\", \"oeffne den "
    "Rechner\"). Common names: \"spotify\", \"calc\", \"notepad\", "
    "\"chrome\", \"edge\", \"explorer\", \"cmd\", \"discord\", \"slack\".\n"
    "* PREFER THE INSTALLED DESKTOP APP over a browser. When the goal names an "
    "app that has a native desktop client (Discord, Slack, Spotify, Telegram, "
    "WhatsApp, Steam, ...), open it with ``open_app`` -- do NOT open it inside "
    "a web browser and do NOT navigate a browser to its website. Only fall "
    "back to the web version when the goal explicitly says 'in the browser' / "
    "'web version', or when a desktop launch clearly did not work (the app is "
    "not installed). open_app already resolves the desktop client across "
    "platforms; if it is unavailable it reports so and you can then try the "
    "browser.\n"
    "* If the target app is ALREADY VISIBLE in the current screenshot, do "
    "NOT call open_app again -- re-launching steals window focus and resets "
    "your progress. Interact with the app's existing window instead.\n"
    "* CHECK THE 'OPEN WINDOWS' LIST (given in the user message when "
    "available): if the app you need is listed there it is ALREADY RUNNING -- "
    "even if its window is minimized and NOT visible in the screenshot. Do NOT "
    "open_app it; emit {\"action\":\"switch_window\",\"name\":\"<a substring of "
    "its title>\"} to bring its window to the front, then continue. This saves "
    "a step and avoids a duplicate window.\n"
    "* DO NOT type the app name into a focused field hoping it is a search "
    "box -- use open_app to launch.\n\n"
    "Hard rules:\n"
    "* x and y are 0-1000 normalized (see COORDINATE SYSTEM above), top-left "
    "origin. NEVER return raw pixel values -- a 4K screen is still 0-1000.\n"
    "* NEVER wrap the JSON in ```json``` fences or any other markup.\n\n"
    "GOAL COMPLETION DISCIPLINE (Scrooge-anti-pattern -- you do NOT get to\n"
    "declare victory by doing nothing):\n"
    "* The user's goal is in the user message ('GOAL: ...'). Before you\n"
    "  respond, internally restate the goal and the OBSERVABLE PROOF that\n"
    "  would mean it is achieved (e.g. 'song is playing' -> a pause-button\n"
    "  icon visible AND a current-time progress > 0:00).\n"
    "* Use \"done\" ONLY when that observable proof is in the CURRENT\n"
    "  screenshot. If the proof is missing, even if the previous step\n"
    "  looked like progress, the goal is NOT achieved -- pick the next\n"
    "  concrete action that advances toward the proof.\n"
    "* Use \"fail\" ONLY when you have attempted at least one concrete\n"
    "  action that should have moved toward the goal and the screen still\n"
    "  does not show any element you can usefully click or type into.\n"
    "  Returning \"fail\" without trying anything is FORBIDDEN.\n"
    "  A \"fail\" is VERIFIED against the current screen: if the goal still\n"
    "  looks achievable your fail is REJECTED and you must keep working --\n"
    "  do NOT use \"fail\" to escape a hard-but-doable task.\n"
    "* If the screen looks unchanged from your previous step, your last\n"
    "  click landed on empty space or the element was not reactive --\n"
    "  pick a DIFFERENT pixel target this time, do not repeat the same\n"
    "  coordinates.\n"
    "* Default mindset: you ARE making progress until the observable\n"
    "  proof is visible. Inaction is not a valid outcome -- pick the\n"
    "  most plausible click target and try it.\n\n"
    "MEDIA TRANSPORT BUTTONS (play/pause are a TOGGLE -- read them like a\n"
    "human). A transport button always shows the icon for what your NEXT\n"
    "click would DO, not the current state:\n"
    "* A PAUSE glyph (two vertical bars) visible => media is ALREADY\n"

    virtual-desktop coordinates.

    BUG-CU-MULTIMON (live 2026-05-28): the screenshot loop captures the
    FOREGROUND monitor (jarvis/vision/screenshot.py::select_capture_monitor).
    The captured image is 0-based, so the vision model returns image-relative
    coordinates. Two facts about those coordinates must both be handled:

    1. SCALE — Gemini returns spatial coordinates on a 0-1000 NORMALIZED grid
       (documented Gemini behaviour, confirmed by the 5-agent deep-dive
       2026-05-28), NOT raw pixels. The loop must convert
       ``pixel = norm / 1000 * monitor_dimension`` before clicking. We scale
       against the MONITOR dimensions (not the image dimensions) so the
       conversion stays correct even if the screenshot is downscaled before
       being sent to the model.
    2. ORIGIN — on a multi-monitor virtual desktop a non-primary monitor can
       have a NEGATIVE origin (e.g. a left monitor at left=-3840).
       ``SetCursorPos`` (jarvis/control/cursor_motion.py) takes ABSOLUTE
       virtual-desktop coordinates, so the monitor origin must be ADDED after
       the normalize-to-pixel step.

    Sourcing left/top AND width/height from the SAME GetMonitorInfo call keeps
    origin and dimensions atomically consistent (no second GetForegroundWindow
    that could read a different monitor).

    On non-Windows hosts the win32 import fails and we fall back to mss monitor
    geometry (B1, DEEP-DIVE-AUDIT-2026-06-19) so a real macOS/Linux DESKTOP
    gets correctly-scaled clicks instead of the model's 0-1000 coords being
    used as raw pixels (which confined every off-Windows click to the top-left
    1000x1000 px square). Returns (0, 0, 0, 0) only on genuine failure or when
    no display/mss is present (headless); callers treat width/height == 0 as

# Plan-first planner (BUG-CU-NO-PLAN, 2026-05-28)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The reactive loop re-decides the next single action from scratch each step,
# so for a multi-step task ("play a song" = open -> search -> type -> select ->
# play) it loses the thread, mashes the most obvious button, and the verifier
# rubber-stamps it. Like Claude-in-Chrome, we make an ordered PLAN first and
# feed it into every executor turn as context, so the model knows the whole
# task structure and which step it is on. The plan is GUIDANCE (the model still
# grounds each click against the live screenshot); it is not a rigid macro.

_PLANNER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are a desktop-automation planner. Look at the screenshot, then output "
    "an ordered plan to accomplish the user goal as a JSON object -- no prose, "
    "no code fences: {\"plan\": [{\"intent\": \"<one atomic UI action, "
    "imperative>\", \"success\": \"<the concrete thing VISIBLE on screen once "
    "this step is done>\"}, ...]}\n"
    "You are a capable agent: reason about a normally-phrased, everyday goal "
    "the way a person would -- you do NOT need the user to spell out every "
    "click. Infer the obvious intermediate steps yourself.\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "* Plan as many steps as the goal naturally needs -- usually a handful. "
    "Each step is ONE concrete UI action: open / click / type / select / "
    "press. Prefer the shortest sequence that genuinely reaches the goal; do "
    "not pad with busywork, and do not cram several actions into one step.\n"
    "* ADAPT as you go: this plan is GUIDANCE, not a rigid macro. The executor "
    "re-observes the live screen after each action and may take an "
    "unplanned/reactive step (or re-plan) when the screen differs from your "
    "expectation -- so plan the sensible happy path and let the executor adapt "
    "to what actually appears.\n"
    "* PREFER THE INSTALLED DESKTOP APP. When the goal names an application "
    "that exists as a native desktop app (Discord, Slack, Spotify, Telegram, "
    "WhatsApp, Steam, a code editor, ...), the FIRST step opens that DESKTOP "
    "app via the open_app action (intent like 'open the discord desktop app') "
    "-- do NOT open the app inside a web browser, and do NOT navigate a browser "
    "to its website, unless the desktop app is genuinely unavailable (e.g. the "
    "goal explicitly says 'in the browser' / 'the web version', or after a "
    "launch attempt the desktop app clearly is not installed). The desktop app "
    "is faster, already signed in, and the path the user means.\n"
    "* LITERAL DICTATION: when the goal dictates specific words to type, say, "
    "write, or enter (e.g. 'type hello hello hello', 'say X'), the typing step's "
    "intent MUST carry those exact words verbatim -- never wrap them in a shell "
    "command or prepend 'echo'. This is distinct from a search topic: only "
    "'search for <topic>' yields a typed query.\n"
    "* Decompose multi-action goals into their real intermediate steps. E.g. "
    "'play a song' is: open the app -> click the search box -> type the song "
    "name -> press Enter -> click the matching track row -> press play -- not a "
    "single 'click play'. Use your own reasoning to find the analogous steps "
    "for the goal in front of you.\n"
    "* 'success' must be something a person could SEE on screen (text in a box, "
    "a result row, a now-playing title, an advancing timer) -- never an "
    "assumption.\n"
    "* The final step's success for media playback is: the elapsed-time counter "
    "is ADVANCING (the song is audibly playing), not merely a pause glyph.\n"
    "* NAVIGATION vs SEARCH (do NOT turn the goal's own words into a site "
    "search): a goal to FIND, READ, SHOW, OPEN, or LOOK AT a specific person's "
    "or account's posts, profile, news, latest, tweets, or page on a website "
    "is accomplished by NAVIGATING to that page (e.g. typing the account's "
    "profile address into the address bar) and STOPPING there. DO NOT type a "
    "descriptor word lifted from the goal -- 'news', 'latest', 'post', "
    "'tweet', 'update', 'profile' -- into the site's SEARCH BOX as a literal "
    "query: that lands on a generic search-results page, NOT the content the "
    "user asked for (recorded failure: 'show Elon Musk's news post on X' was "
    "mis-decomposed into a search for the literal word 'news', which derailed "
    "an otherwise-finished task). Only plan a typed search when the goal names "
    "an explicit TOPIC to search FOR (e.g. 'search YouTube for lo-fi beats' -> "
    "type 'lo-fi beats'); a person's name or account is a NAVIGATION target, "
    "not a search topic. For a 'see <account>'s posts/news on <site>' goal the "
    "final step's success is that account's page being visible -- never a "
    "search box containing one of the goal's words.\n"
