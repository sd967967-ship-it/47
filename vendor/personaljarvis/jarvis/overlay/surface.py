"""Cross-platform Orb ``OverlaySurface`` seam (Wave 2, sub-task 2.5; AD-6/AD-7/AD-11).

The orb overlay follows the uniform AD-6 seam: an ``OverlaySurface`` ``Protocol``,
a per-OS implementation, a ``detect_platform()`` factory, and a graceful
null-fallback that logs an English message and never raises.

The visual ladder (AD-11):

* ``win32`` / ``darwin`` → :class:`TkColorKeyOverlay`, which **wraps** the live Tk
  orb (``ui/orb/overlay.py`` ``OrbOverlay``). Tk's ``-transparentcolor`` (Win32
  ``LWA_COLORKEY`` on Windows, the Cocoa equivalent on macOS) works on both, per
  the Wave-0 verdict in ``docs/plans/cross-platform-mac-linux/ADR-orb-framework.md``.
  The color-key rendering path inside ``OrbOverlay`` is **not** touched (AD-7) —
  the wrapper only adapts its lifecycle (``start``/``stop``/``set_state``/
  ``is_visible``) to this Protocol.
* ``linux`` with a display and not Wayland → :class:`LinuxBestEffortOverlay`
  (defined in ``jarvis/overlay/linux_surface.py``), which itself degrades to the
  tray floor when the color-key probe fails.
* anything else (no display, ``not has_overlay``, headless €5-VPS) →
  :class:`TrayOnlySurface` (``jarvis/overlay/tray_surface.py``), the universal
  floor driving the already-cross-platform pystray tray (``jarvis/ui/tray.py``).

The Windows system-cursor swap (``jarvis/overlay/system_cursor.py``,
``SetSystemCursor``) stays Windows-only — it has no macOS/Linux equivalent and is
deliberately **not** wired into this surface (AD-11). Its existing call site in
``jarvis/ui/desktop_app.py`` stays gated on Windows.

Import-cleanliness contract (HN-7): nothing here imports Tk, the ``ui.orb``
package, ``pystray``, or any platform-only package at module scope. Every such
import is lazy + guarded inside a method body, so ``import jarvis.overlay.surface``
succeeds on a headless Linux VPS that has none of them installed.
