"""Cross-platform drag-drop target for the floating overlay (bar + mascot).

The desktop power-user extra that lets a user drop files / text **directly onto
the always-on-top Tk bar or mascot** (not just the in-app web dock). It follows
the AD-6 seam shape used across ``jarvis/overlay/``: a ``DropTarget`` Protocol, a
real implementation, a graceful null no-op, and a ``make_drop_target()`` factory
that never raises.

Cross-platform by construction: the real implementation drives the **tkdnd** Tcl
extension via ``tkinterdnd2`` (bundled binaries for Windows / macOS / Linux,
verified loading + registering on Windows and Linux), registered onto the
existing Tk root **without replacing it** (``_require`` on the live root —
compatible with the cached-root constraint, BUG-031). Where ``tkinterdnd2`` / the
``tkdnd`` binary fails to load (headless €5-VPS, an arch without a bundled binary,
or — on Linux — the X11 runtime libs the tkdnd ``.so`` links against are absent),
``register`` returns ``False`` and the factory/overlay degrade to a logged no-op
— the web dock (``POST /api/chat/drop``) still carries the feature on every OS,
so this extra is purely additive.

**Linux runtime note (verified 2026-06-22):** the bundled ``linux-x64``
``libtkdnd2.9.5.so`` links against X11 libs (``libXcursor.so.1`` et al.). A real
Linux *desktop* running X11 has these; a bare ``python:3.11-slim`` does not, so
``register`` returns ``False`` there (correctly — a headless box has no overlay
anyway). Distro packages: ``libxcursor1 libxrender1 libxext6`` (+ ``python3-tk``).

Import-cleanliness (HN-7): nothing here imports ``tkinterdnd2`` / Tk at module
scope, so ``import jarvis.overlay.drop_target`` stays clean on a headless host.
The dropped content is delivered to an ``on_drop(paths, text)`` callback; wiring
that callback to the brain intake (``jarvis/brain/drop_context.ingest_drop``)
lives in the desktop bridge, off this module.
