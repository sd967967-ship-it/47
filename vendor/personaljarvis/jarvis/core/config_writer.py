"""Atomic edits to the jarvis.toml configuration at runtime.

Used by the provider-switch endpoint so that a user's change of Brain provider
updates not only the BrainManager's in-memory state but also the persistent default
selection in jarvis.toml. tomlkit preserves comments and formatting — the user has
many explanatory comments in jarvis.toml that must not be lost.

Writes atomically via a tempfile + os.replace (atomic on NTFS).

BOM handling: On Windows it is common for editors (Notepad, VS Code with
``files.encoding=utf8bom``) to prepend a UTF-8 BOM. ``tomlkit.parse``
does not tolerate this and raises EmptyKeyError. We strip the BOM on read and
write it back on save — so the file stays byte-identical for tools that expect
the BOM, while the patch is still applied in-place.

    The problem it fixes (BUG-010 config drift). ``hotkey_dictate`` shipped as
    ``""`` for a while, so every install from that period has ``hotkey_dictate
    = ""`` written into its ``jarvis.toml``. A persisted empty string beats the
    code default, so when the default became a real combo those installs kept
    reading "no key assigned" — while ``hotkey_dictate_toggle``, which was
    never persisted because it did not exist yet, WAS armed from the new
    default. Same feature, two different answers, decided by which key happened
    to be in the file.

    Why ``""`` is not simply treated as "use the default": that would make the
    Clear button impossible. An unbound shortcut is a state the user is
    entitled to, and it has to survive restarts. So the two cases are told
    apart by a MARKER rather than by the value:

    * marker absent  -> this install has never been through the migration, so
      an empty value is stale rather than chosen: write the current default.
    * marker present -> every empty value from here on was chosen by the user
      and is left alone forever.

    The marker is written the first time the migration has a stale value to
    consider, and never otherwise: this function is reached from
    ``load_config``, so a config file that has nothing to heal must come back
    from a load byte-identical. The OTHER writer of the marker is
    :func:`set_keybind` — an explicit save of a dictation shortcut, empty or
    not, is proof the user has seen the value and chosen it, so it stamps the
    marker too. Between them, an install where the keys are simply ABSENT is
    never rewritten by a boot, and a Clear performed there is still permanent.

    A default is skipped (while the marker is still written) when its key set
    is a subset or superset of another shortcut already in the file: the
    polling hotkey backend fires on subsets, so backfilling there would hand
    the user two shortcuts that trigger each other. Better an unbound row the
    user can fill in than a config the keybind route itself would refuse to
    save.

    Returns True when the file was rewritten. Best-effort by design: a missing
    file, unparsable TOML or a failed write degrades to a logged no-op — a boot
    heal must never break a boot.

    (``PUT /api/providers/{id}/realtime-options``) so a change is persisted in

    Three-layer persist (like ``set_brain_primary`` / ``set_worker_provider``):
    ``model`` / ``deep_model`` / ``tool_model`` / ``voice`` are pinned in

    drift-guard within 5 minutes (BUG-010 class) — exactly the "I picked a model
    and it flipped back" symptom. We therefore sync config-soll.json too. No ENV  # i18n-allow
    layer is written: per-provider model keys have no effective ``JARVIS__*``
    override (the boot override only nests on ``__`` and the drift-guard's dotted
    ``JARVIS__BRAIN.PROVIDERS.*`` vars are inert), so adding one would only create
    a new stale-override trap. Layer 2 is best-effort (cloud-first): a graceful
    no-op on a headless Linux VPS, it never raises out of this function nor
    breaks the TOML write.

    Idempotent: if the block is absent it is created; ``None`` values change
    nothing.

    Returns a :class:`WriteReceipt`. After the baseline sync the file is
    re-read and compared key by key; a mismatch (read-only file, a foreign
    writer racing, a broken JSON) is logged at ERROR with the key and comes
    back as ``baseline_ok=False`` so the caller can warn that the drift guard may
    revert the pick. Existing callers may ignore the return value.
