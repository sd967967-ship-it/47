"""Process-wide references to the live runtime objects the brain tools need.

The App-Control tools (``describe-app-settings``, ``switch-provider``,
``manage-mcp-server``) run *inside* the BrainManager's tool loop, but they need
to reach runtime objects that are owned by the app/server layer and only exist
*after* the brain is built:

- the live ``BrainManager`` (to switch the brain provider live, no restart),
- the live ``SpeechPipeline`` (to hot-swap the TTS provider),
- the live ``MCPRegistry`` (to reload/start MCP servers after an mcp.json edit).

This module is the single, centralised home for those references — the same
lazy-singleton pattern already used for the MissionManager / Kontrollierer in
``jarvis/brain/factory.py`` (``set_mission_manager`` etc.), but collected in one
low-layer module so the tools import *one* thing and the bootstrap sites set
*one* thing.

A ``None`` getter return is honest: "not yet wired / not available in this
runtime" (e.g. a headless brain build before the server bootstrap, or voice
disabled so there is no SpeechPipeline). Callers degrade to "persisted, restart
required" rather than crashing — the anti-silent-drop contract (AD-OE6).

Thread-safety: assignment of a single object reference is atomic in CPython, and
these are write-once-at-bootstrap / read-many. No lock needed.
