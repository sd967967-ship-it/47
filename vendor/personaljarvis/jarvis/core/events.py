#:     No speech-to-text provider is wired, so nothing could transcribe.
#: ``already_running``
#:     A dictation is already recording (or a handover is in flight); the
#:     second start is a no-op.
#: ``handover_failed``
#:     A live voice conversation owned the microphone, the dictation asked it to

#:     dictation key press is a deliberate user action and now WINS over a

#:     longer a refusal at all.
#: ``voice_session_active``
#:     LEGACY. A voice conversation (wake word or push-to-talk) owned the
#:     microphone and the dictation gave up instead of taking over. No longer
#:     published — kept in the vocabulary because an older backend can still
#:     send it to a newer UI, and a consumer that dropped the token would then
#:     render an unknown-reason blank.
#: ``pipeline_not_running``
#:     The speech pipeline has no running event loop to host the session.
#:
#: The last three belong to the "insert the last dictation again" key rather
#: than to a recording. It starts nothing, so it can never be refused for a
#: microphone reason — but it CAN do nothing at all, and a key that does
#: nothing in silence is the exact failure this vocabulary exists to prevent.
#:
#: ``nothing_to_paste``
#:     The history holds no dictation to re-insert (nothing recorded yet, or
#:     every entry was discarded).
#: ``history_disabled``
#:     ``[dictation].history_enabled`` is off, so no transcript was kept and
#:     there is nothing this key could paste. Recoverable in the settings.
#: ``paste_unavailable``
#:     The text could not be typed into the focused window — Wayland, a
#:     headless host, an elevated window in front, macOS secure input. The
