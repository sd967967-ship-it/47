"""Central CPU-first compute-device selection policy.

Single source of truth for the question "which compute device may this component
use?". Personal Jarvis is cloud-first: the baseline user is on a headless
``python:3.11-slim`` VPS with no GPU, never the maintainer's CUDA workstation
(CLAUDE.md §3, ``docs/adr/0024-cpu-first-device-selection.md``). So the DEFAULT
is always CPU, and a GPU is used only when a component BOTH (a) is EXPLICITLY
asked for one via config, AND (b) has a VERIFIED capability to run it.

This module owns rule (a) — the *policy*. It deliberately does NOT own rule (b)
— the *capability verdict* — which is injected as the ``cuda_usable`` argument,
because the correct capability probe differs per consumer: the always-on wake
path MUST gate on the strict out-of-process inference probe, never on bare CUDA
presence (AP-25), while a latency-tolerant utterance path may pass a cheaper
verdict or ``None`` and let the backend self-heal. Keeping the capability out of
this module also keeps it a pure, dependency-light, instantly testable decision
function that never imports ``torch`` / ``ctranslate2`` and therefore adds no
boot cost and never sits on the AP-26 critical path.
