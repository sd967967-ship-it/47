"""Google GenAI client construction with AI-Studio-vs-Vertex key routing.

Google ships two API-key families for the same Gemini models:

* **Google AI Studio** keys — classic ``AIza...`` and newer ``AQ....`` —
  served by ``generativelanguage.googleapis.com``.
* **Vertex AI express mode** keys — also ``AQ....`` — served by
  ``aiplatform.googleapis.com`` and only accepted when the google-genai
  client is built with ``vertexai=True``.

The prefix alone cannot distinguish the two ``AQ.`` families, and a key sent
to the wrong endpoint fails with an auth error ("API key not valid"). This
module is the single source of truth for picking the route, shared by every
surface that builds a Gemini client (brain, tool model, realtime, STT, TTS,
dictation polish, computer use, ack brain):

* ``AIza...`` keys route straight to AI Studio — zero added latency, the
  exact behaviour every install had before this module existed.
* Ambiguous ``AQ....`` keys are probed ONCE per process, in two steps: a
  cheap ``models.list`` GET against AI Studio, and — only if AI Studio
  rejects the key — a free Vertex ``countTokens`` counter-probe. Accepted by
  AI Studio → AI Studio; accepted by Vertex → express key; rejected by BOTH
  → the key is simply invalid, so the historical AI Studio path surfaces
  Google's own error and nothing is cached. A confirmed verdict is cached by
  key fingerprint, so realtime session opens and per-turn calls never pay
  the probe again.
* ``[google].vertex_mode`` in jarvis.toml overrides the probe: ``always``
  forces Vertex for ambiguous keys, ``never`` restores the pre-Vertex
  behaviour. ``auto`` (default) probes. Read only here (AP-31).

An explicitly configured ``base_url`` (team proxy, W2) must bypass routing
entirely — the proxy speaks the AI Studio wire format — which callers get by
passing ``route="aistudio"`` to :func:`build_genai_client`.

Everything above is about a key stored in the GEMINI slots, where the endpoint
has to be inferred. The dedicated ``vertex`` provider family is the other case:
there the user picked Vertex explicitly, so :func:`build_vertex_client` pins the
route with no probe at all and additionally serves the FULL Google Cloud path —
``[google].vertex_project``/``vertex_location`` with Application Default
Credentials instead of a key.

Which of the two a caller lands on is not a preference. Measured 2026-08-17
against a live Cloud project: Vertex accepts an API key ONLY in express mode. A
standard Cloud API key — including one created with
``--api-target=service=aiplatform.googleapis.com`` — is refused on every Vertex
surface (countTokens, generateContent, and the Live socket, which closes with
1008) with "API keys are not supported by this API. Expected OAuth2 access token
or other authentication credentials that assert a principal", while the very
same key answers 200 on AI Studio. So for an ordinary Cloud project the project
path is the only route in, and the express key is the exception.
