"""Cross-platform helpers for the process quirks a desktop app hits.

The helpers cover a windowed Python process without standard streams, spawning
subprocesses without flashing console windows (``NO_WINDOW_CREATIONFLAGS``),
and stopping Windows from replacing an unresponsive window with an opaque ghost
(``disable_windows_app_ghosting``). The Windows-only helpers are no-ops elsewhere.

Background:
    The desktop app runs under ``pythonw.exe`` (no attached console). When a
    child process is started without explicit ``creationflags``, Windows
    allocates a fresh console window for every child — for ``npx``, ``git``,
    ``uvx`` and CLI probes that means a flicker storm of black terminals
    popping up and closing during normal startup.

    Setting ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW`` on every spawn makes children silently
    inherit no-console state. ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` accepts the
    same Windows constants as ``subprocess.Popen``.

Usage:
    from jarvis.core.process_utils import NO_WINDOW_CREATIONFLAGS

    proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
        *cmd,
        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        creationflags=NO_WINDOW_CREATIONFLAGS,
    )

On non-Windows platforms ``NO_WINDOW_CREATIONFLAGS`` is ``0`` and the
parameter is silently ignored by the subprocess machinery.

    an ordinary window: it does **not** inherit ``WS_EX_LAYERED``, so the Jarvis

    rectangle lands on screen as an opaque BLACK box around the pill.

    Tk loop, and that loop stops pumping whenever *another* thread holds the GIL
    through a long CPU-bound stretch — a slow config load on the backend thread
    is enough. The user sees a black rectangle around their bar and nothing else
