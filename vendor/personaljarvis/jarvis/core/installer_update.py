"""Self-update for a FROZEN install — the one that arrived as a native installer.

A frozen install (Windows ``Setup.exe``, macOS ``.dmg``, Linux ``.AppImage``)
has no git checkout, so ``jarvis/ui/web/update_routes.py``'s managed path cannot
update it. What it does have is a GitHub Release carrying exactly one installer
asset per platform plus a ``installers-SHA256SUMS.txt`` manifest:

* ``PersonalJarvis-Setup-x64.exe``          Windows 10/11 x64
* ``PersonalJarvis-macOS-arm64.dmg``        Apple Silicon
* ``PersonalJarvis-macOS-x64.dmg``          Intel Mac
* ``PersonalJarvis-Linux-x86_64.AppImage``  Linux x86_64

This module resolves which of those belongs to the running machine, downloads
it, proves it byte-for-byte against the checksum manifest of the SAME release,
and then hands control to the platform's own upgrade mechanism.

Two rules run through everything here:

* **Fail closed.** A missing asset, a missing or unparsable checksum manifest, a
  digest that does not match, an oversized body, an unexpected redirect target —
  every one of them raises :class:`InstallerUpdateError` and installs nothing.
  Executing an unverified binary is the single worst thing an updater can do.
* **Injectable edges.** Network and process spawning arrive as small protocols
  (:class:`AssetFetcher`, :class:`CommandRunner`), so the whole flow — including
  the macOS and Linux handovers — is exercised on any OS with fakes and without
  a network.

Every subprocess goes out with ``NO_WINDOW_CREATIONFLAGS`` (AP-1) so a windowed
build never flashes a console.
