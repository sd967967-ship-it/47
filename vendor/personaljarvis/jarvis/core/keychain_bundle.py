"""macOS Keychain item-count collapse for Jarvis secrets (BUG-103).

On macOS every distinct ``keyring.set_password``/``get_password`` call
becomes its own Keychain item under the same service. An unsigned
interpreter (the dev venv ``python``) is not code-signed, so the OS
re-prompts "Allow / Always Allow / Deny" separately for EACH item — the
pre-boot key check alone touches roughly ten provider slots, producing a
storm of 5-10+ dialogs on every single boot.

``DarwinBundleKeyringBackend`` wraps the platform-detected keyring backend
(composition, not a registered ``keyring`` plugin) and collapses every
secret into ONE Keychain item — account name ``__jarvis_vault__`` — holding
a JSON object that maps key -> value. Every later get/set/delete is served
from an in-process cache with no further per-item OS prompt.

**Why one item is still not enough (the v2 layer).** Since macOS Sierra a
Keychain item also carries a *partition list*: even an item whose ACL says
"any application may read" silently admits only Apple-signed tools; every
unsigned binary (the venv python) still triggers the confirmation dialog —
and because "Always Allow" is bound to a code signature the unsigned
interpreter does not have, the grant never sticks. Each fresh python
process (main app, mission worker, CLI, pytest) then re-prompts once per
boot. The fix: route the vault item's I/O through ``/usr/bin/security`` —
an Apple-signed tool inside the ``apple-tool:`` partition — and create the
item with the "allow any application" ACL (``add-generic-password -A``).
Items written that way are readable and writable via the CLI with ZERO
dialogs, from any process, forever, regardless of interpreter signing.

Security tradeoff, stated honestly: a ``-A`` item is readable by any local
process running as the user (same trust level as this project's 0600
file-store fallback), while remaining Keychain-encrypted at rest and locked
with the keychain. The alternative was an unfixable per-process dialog
storm, because an unsigned interpreter can never hold a durable grant.

Secrets never appear on a command line: writes stream the payload to
``security -i`` via stdin, reads receive it on stdout. The payload is the
base64-encoded JSON bundle — base64 doubles as the format marker that the
item was already rewritten with the ``-A`` ACL (plain JSON means a
keyring-written legacy vault that still needs the one-time upgrade).

Windows and Linux never construct this class: ``jarvis/core/config.py`` only
wraps the platform backend when ``sys.platform == "darwin"``, so their
per-item keyring behavior is byte-identical to before this module existed.
