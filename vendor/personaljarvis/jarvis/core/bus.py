"""Async Event Bus — local pub/sub infrastructure.

Responsibilities:
- Decouples layers (L2 Speech publishes UtteranceCaptured, L3 Intent subscribes).
- Trace-ID-based correlation for debug replay.
- Delivers events to the flight recorder (when enabled).

Can be swapped for a Redis bus later when running multi-process.

# Hard cap on how long a *wildcard* subscriber (an observer/fan-out handler
# registered via ``subscribe_all`` -- WebSocket forwarders, channel adapters,
# recorders) may take before the bus abandons it for THIS dispatch.
#
# Rationale (BUG-CU-STALL, 2026-05-29 / AP-18): ``publish`` awaits every
# subscriber via ``asyncio.gather``. A wildcard observer that blocks -- e.g. a
# WebSocket ``send_json`` to a stalled/half-open browser tab, or a channel API
# call to a dead socket -- has NO natural bound and would freeze the *entire*
# event bus. Because the voice and Computer-Use dispatch paths publish through
# this bus (``ActionProposed``, ``HarnessDispatched``), one wedged browser tab
# silently froze a Computer-Use mission for ~28 s until the voice idle-timeout
# hung up -- "stood ready, did nothing". The module docstring of ``publish``
# already promised "a broken subscriber must never block the pipeline";
# this enforces it for the observer class that can actually block.
#
# Typed subscribers (``subscribe(EventType, ...)``) are deliberately NOT capped:
# a publisher may legitimately depend on them, and some (the TTS announcement
# handler) await audio playback for several seconds by design. The cap is
# generous enough that no healthy local observer is ever cut, yet far below the
# voice idle-timeout so a genuine wedge can never reach it.
