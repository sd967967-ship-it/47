"""Augment the process PATH with well-known CLI install locations.

GUI-launched processes do not inherit the user's shell PATH: on macOS an app
started from Finder/Dock/launchd gets the minimal ``/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:
/sbin`` (no Homebrew, no npm-global, no ``~/.local/bin``), and on Windows a
fresh installer can update only the registry PATH or place a binary in an app-
specific user directory. Already-running processes see neither change. Every
``shutil.which``-based CLI probe (claude / codex / agy / gemini / node / npm,
the CLI-tools catalog prober, worker spawns) then reports a perfectly-installed
binary as "not installed" — the 2026-07-18 Mac-test-machine symptom: Claude
Code installed via the shell, the desktop app insisting it is missing.

``ensure_cli_paths()`` appends the well-known, actually-existing install dirs
to ``os.environ["PATH"]``. Existing entries keep priority — only *missing*
dirs are appended, so a user-managed PATH always wins and the call is
idempotent. Pure ``stat()`` probes, no subprocess: boot-budget-safe (AP-26).

Cross-platform per CLOUD.md Rule #1: the candidate list covers macOS
(Intel + Apple Silicon Homebrew), Linux (incl. headless), and Windows; a dir
that does not exist on this host is simply skipped.
