"""A default executor that is already at full size when the loop first needs it.

``asyncio.to_thread`` is the app's standard way of keeping blocking work off the
event loop, and it is used in roughly 420 places. It is not, however, free of the
loop: every call goes through ``loop.run_in_executor(None, ...)``, which calls
``ThreadPoolExecutor._adjust_thread_count()``, and when no worker is idle and the
pool has not reached ``max_workers`` yet, that method calls ``Thread.start()``
**synchronously, on the calling thread** — the event loop. ``Thread.start()``
waits for the new thread to signal that it is running, so a host under load pays
that wait with the whole loop stopped.

Measured on the maintainer's box 2026-07-29 (``data/jarvis_desktop.log``), that
is not theoretical. Three of the session's worst stalls had this exact stack::

    audio/topology.py:225 watch_topology
      asyncio/threads.py:25 to_thread
        base_events.py:867 run_in_executor
          concurrent/futures/thread.py:203 _adjust_thread_count
            threading.py:999 Thread.start
              threading.py:655 wait          <-- 75.7 s

While the loop is stopped, every WebSocket frame, every HTTP route, every brain
turn and every terminal pane's output is stopped with it — which is what the user
reports as "the whole app is dead" and as a coding-CLI pane that never draws.

The fix is not to audit 420 call sites: it is to make the pool never have to
grow. :func:`install_prewarmed_default_executor` installs a pool of a known size
and brings every worker up **from a background thread**, so the one place where
``Thread.start()`` is unavoidable is a thread nobody is waiting on. Afterwards
``num_threads == max_workers`` forever, ``_adjust_thread_count`` returns without
starting anything, and ``to_thread`` costs the loop a queue append.

This does not make blocking work free — a call that blocks for a minute still
occupies a worker for a minute, and with every worker busy the next ``to_thread``
waits in the queue. That is the correct failure mode: work queues, the loop keeps
running, and the app stays answerable.
