"""Run / iteration / result data classes for the review pipeline (Phase 8.2).

Plan reference: §6.2 (skeleton `RunState`/`IterationRecord`/`PipelineResult`).

Mutable vs. immutable separation:
- `RunState` is mutable because the pipeline appends to it per iteration.
- `PipelineResult` is `frozen=True` — final state; no caller may later swap
  candidates or manipulate verdicts.
- `IterationRecord` is `frozen=True` — a completed iteration is history;
  the pipeline skeleton must not mutate individual records.

The audit log entry per iteration is NOT modelled here; that is handled
separately by `ReviewAudit.append_iteration` from Phase 8.1. RunState
remains audit-free so that tests can compare state without side effects.
