"""BrainManager: Intent-Router + Smart-Fallback + Pipeline-Adapter.

Architecture:

1. **Router** (`jarvis/brain/router.py`) classifies user intent:
   - `fast` → fast model (Haiku) for tool actions, smalltalk
   - `deep` → reasoning model (Opus) for analysis, planning, explanation
   - `code` → Jarvis-Agent-backed heavy worker

2. **Model-Cache**: `(provider_name, model) → Brain-Instance` — multiple
   models of the same family coexist without re-instantiation.

3. **Fallback-Chain**: On error (429, 500, auth, …) the manager tries in order:
   - same provider, deep_model (if fast is rate-limited, try deeper)
   - `claude-api` (OAuth Max plan)
   - `claude-api` (separate quota)
   - `gemini`, `openrouter`, `openai` (when keys are present)
   - Ollama was completely removed from the project on 2026-04-21.

4. **Pipeline-Adapter**: `__call__(text) -> str` for `speech/pipeline.py`.

5. **Voice-Commands**: "wechsel auf gemini", "denk gründlich", "denk schnell".

# BUG-LIVE-04 (Recon-Agent 3, 2026-05-16): Whisper transcribes silence,

# 2026-05-17 (H2 from audit-team 10): the original single-set + startswith

        Wave-4 migration: previously there were two tiers, ``router`` and
        ``sub_jarvis``. The Sub-Jarvis tier was replaced by the Jarvis-Agent
        bridge (see docs/jarvis-agents-bridge.md §11); only ``router`` remains.

        Reads `config.brain.router` and writes into a deep copy of JarvisConfig:
          - `brain.primary = tier_cfg.provider` (or `provider_override`)
          - `brain.deep_brain = tier_cfg.fallback_provider`, UNLESS a
            `provider_override` collapses a non-split tier (fallback in
            {None, provider}) — then deep_brain follows the override so a
            user-chosen frontier provider leads deep/code too (see below).

        The global `config` instance is left unchanged.

        Args:
            provider_override: When set, `tier_cfg.provider` is ignored and
                the override is used. This is the hook for the live provider
                switch: when the user says "wechsel auf gemini" via voice.
                The associated `tier_cfg.model` is then NOT used (it was
                intended for the original provider) — instead the default
                from TIER_DEFAULTS_BY_PROVIDER applies for the new provider.

        Bug fix 2026-05-01 (voice session 2026-04-30 22:38): when smalltalk is
        clearly identified, ``tools_override={}`` is set — the LLM then has no
        tools in its toolbox and cannot be tempted to hallucinate
        ``spawn_worker``. ``None`` (default) = full tool visibility.

        ``max_turns`` / ``deadline_s`` (2026-07-14): per-turn loop bounds for
        delegated realtime voice turns — see ``_DELEGATE_MAX_TURNS`` /
        ``_DELEGATE_DEADLINE_S``. ``None`` keeps the dispatcher defaults.

        ``reasoning_effort`` (2026-07-17): forwarded onto every BrainRequest
        of the turn. Delegated realtime voice turns pass ``"none"`` so a
        thinking-by-default model never burns seconds of internal reasoning
        per tool-loop round — see ``_DELEGATE_REASONING_EFFORT``.

        ``tool_context`` (2026-08-24): extra keys merged into every tool's
        ``ExecutionContext.config`` for this dispatcher's turns — scheduled
        task turns pass ``{"delivery": "written"}`` so search results stop
        asking for a spoken two-liner. ``None`` = no extra keys.

        ``delegated_voice`` (2026-07-17): appends the static speed contract
        (``_DELEGATE_VOICE_DIRECTIVE``) — batch lookups, no repeats, answer
        as soon as evidence suffices — to the system prompt of delegated
        voice turns only, so classic chat prompts stay byte-identical.

        The tool surface is then sized to the brain's context window
        (2026-08-27, ``_fit_tools_to_brain``); the turn's message log counts
        toward that — a delegated turn's from ``_TURN_HISTORY_OVERRIDE``, a

        tool-execution + readback window speaks a short interim line. This
        bridges the wait on slow turns (e.g. a cold email/calendar fetch, a
        multi-tool research) where the persona forbids any spoken preamble
        before the tool and round-2 has not started yet.

        Contextual Interim Voice (2026-07-06 v2 spec): when the manager's
        ``ReadbackComposer`` has a live flash provider, the spoken text is
        COMPOSED for this exact turn (user request + concrete action) instead
        of drawn from a phrase pool — the pool line remains only as the
        instant deterministic fallback (keyless install, breaker open,
        timeout, rejected output). Composition + publish run fire-and-forget
        so the tool-use loop is never delayed; ``[ack_brain].contextual_interim
        = false`` is the kill switch back to pools-only.

        Returns ``None`` when there is no bus, the feature is off
        (``[ack_brain].grounded_tool_ack = false``), or the utterance is a
        Voice-Control command (the action itself is the confirmation).

        GROUNDED, not speculative: unlike the retired Flash-Brain preamble it
        fires only after a real tool decision, never on suspicion. The fallback
        words are rendered by ``generate_ack`` (skip-list-aware, so passive
        reads / low-latency UI events stay silent) and the language is
        re-resolved and re-scrubbed authoritatively at the speech layer, so the
        reply-language pin and conversation stickiness still win there.
        Publishing with ``source_layer="brain.router.ack"`` keeps every
        pipeline gate on this source: the necessity commit-grace (speak only if
        the brain is STILL busy), duplicate-wording dedup, the rate-limit
        backstop, and the legacy one-ack-per-turn drop while the Flash-Brain

        turns (``_smalltalk_tool_override``), so the LLM can no longer spawn.

        hint measurably did nothing — 60 NARROW hints shipped over 14 live days
        and the model called run-skill exactly zero times. The fast router
        model does not convert a suggestion into a tool round trip. So for a
        CLEAR top candidate that cannot dispatch anything, the hint now carries
        the skill's full rendered instructions in a conditional frame — the
        model only has to decide "is this what the user meant", not decide AND
        remember to call a tool (mirrors Claude Code loading a skill's whole
        instruction body once selected). The decision explicitly stays with
        the model: a wrong candidate is ignored, never executed, so a skill is
        still only ever used when it serves the request.

        A dispatching-class candidate (mission execution, block tier, macro
        body) NEVER gets its instructions inlined off an inferred match — its
        body is a process-start directive, and no matcher may authorize that
        (same line ``autofire_policy.may_capture`` draws). It keeps the plain
        named hint, where the model must consciously call ``run-skill``.

        Deliberately rides the PER-TURN context and never the cached system
        prefix: rewriting that prefix per turn would break prompt caching on
        every single turn, which costs far more than it could ever save.

        Returns ``None`` on a captured turn, a dead scorer, or a weak ranking —
        so the common case adds nothing at all.

        Computer-Use from both running for one utterance (docs/screen-context.md
        §3.1a, maintainer mandate 2026-08-02). The first exception was a WRITE
        mandate (code-review finding 2026-08-08): "erstell einen Ordner hier auf
        dem Desktop" matches the screen-intent phrase "hier auf dem", the
        explicit screen-context path attaches a screenshot, and a zeroed surface
        blinded the very run_shell call the local-outcome mandate requires.

        2026-08-17: the hide is now a narrow deny-list, because the boundary it

        from an earlier utterance, from an explicit attach, or from a mixed
        request — and an emptied surface left the model describing a picture

        Two distinct risks with two distinct pieces of evidence — and "the
        action regex did not fire" is neither of them. The forensics:

        1. **Inheritance (2026-06-27).** "Was geht ab?" → STT "Lask it up!" [en]
           conf 0.509 → the router-LLM, reading a 30k-token context full of the
           prior "open Discord, bridge-mine channel" command, re-ran that exact
           computer_use plan on a turn that asked for nothing. That risk needs
           something to inherit: a desktop episode that is live or just ended
           (``_desktop_episode_is_live``). Cold, there is no prior plan in the
           context to re-run.
        2. **Write reflex (deep-dive 2026-06-30).** A "does my budget fit?" turn
           carried google_calendar / contact-upsert / wiki-ingest /
           update_profile in its surface. The evidence there is the turn's own
           shape: smalltalk or a plain question asks for no record to be written
           (``_turn_reads_as_conversation``).

        What changed, and why (2026-08-17 review): the previous version hid both
        sets from EVERY turn that missed ``is_open_app_intent`` /
        ``_looks_like_pc_control`` / the capability registry. That regex knows
        "klick" and "Bildschirm"; it does not know "spiel Musik", "ruf Anna an"
        or "trag das in meinen Kalender ein" — so those turns reached the model
        with no vehicle at all and could only be talked about. Absence of a
        keyword is not evidence of absence of intent. A tool the model declines
        to call is free; a tool it cannot see is the bug users report.

        Both protections above still fire, on their own evidence. A genuine
        action signal (action-intent, artifact-build request, named spawn
        vehicle, request framing) short-circuits the gate, the read-only ``screenshot``
        tool is never hidden, and a tool the deterministic layer mandated this
        turn is never stripped (AD-CLI8). Pure regex + registry lookups, no
        model in the path (AP-11 safe). Any fault returns the tools unchanged so

        neither it nor computer_use and spoke the dictated capability refusal
        ("mir fehlt dafür das passende Werkzeug"). The vehicle the user NAMED
        (the desktop) must outrank a loose skill CONTENT match — and the
        surest way to stop a wrong tool call is to not offer the tool (mirrors
        the knowledge-question / plugin-tool hides above).

        Narrow on purpose: fires ONLY when a deterministic pc-control /
        open-app signal is present AND ``computer_use`` is actually in the
        surface (a host without the CU harness keeps run-skill so the turn
        stays handleable). Stands down when the user literally says "skill" —
        an explicit skill request is its own vehicle. The deterministic
        trigger-match inline path (AD-S4) is untouched: a skill whose OWN
        trigger phrase matched rides the turn context before this gate and
        needs no run-skill call. Pure regex + existing detectors (AP-11 safe,
        provider-agnostic). Defensive: any fault returns the tools unchanged
        so a gate bug can never blind the brain.

        the situation it matters most: on 2026-07-25 (voice session 15:47) "let

        "Spawn five more Claude Code terminals" is a workspace request, but it

        (that precedence lives in ``intent.owns_turn``, which both routing gates

           recently used one, and it is NAMED in the reply — it is an assumption,
           and the user has to be able to hear a wrong one.
        2. **The open UI is told.** Panes added from outside the workspace view
           are invisible to it (it fetches its state once, on mount), so the new
           pane list is published on the bus.
        3. **The view is brought forward.** This is also what STARTS the agents:
           ``add_terminals`` creates the registry entries, and each agent's
           pseudo-terminal spawns when its pane mounts.

        Returns ``None`` on every turn that is not a terminal-spawn request, so

             test — a multi-step artefact brief → True (mandate 2026-08-18).

             trigger in step 3 did not catch → False (mandate 2026-07-21).
             ``permissive`` additionally keeps the legacy heuristic: action

                # most providers that's correct (an HTTP error is purely

                # "CachedContent not found" means the locally-cached
                # ``self._cached_content_name`` is stale — and because we
                # don't clear it here, every subsequent voice turn re-uses
                # the same dead cache id and re-fails, sending the whole
                # fallback chain into the 40-second pipeline timeout and
                # leaving the user with silent THINKING → LISTENING. The
                # root-cause annotation lives at the actual failure site
                # in ``jarvis/plugins/brain/gemini.py`` (search for

        Yields each brain text chunk in real time. Tool-use loops run as
        usual; pre-tool-use text is also streamed (the persona prompt forbids
        fillers, so this is uncritical). Evidence-gated turns are buffered
        until ``generate`` returns its authoritative final text, because the
        post-call evidence or action-honesty enforcement may replace an
        unverified stream.

        ``on_progress`` (stall-timeout signal): forwarded to the tool-use loop,
        which pings it at every model-round + tool boundary. The speech pipeline
        passes its ``_mark_brain_progress`` here so its *no-progress* deadline
        resets while a vision/tool turn is genuinely working but streaming no
        text (live bug 2026-06-01). ``None`` (default) is a no-op.

        Consumed via an ``asyncio.Queue`` between the producer task
        (``generate``) and the caller (``async for``). If the caller cancels
        the generator, the producer is also cancelled.
