"""A per-turn pick for ``BrainManager.generate``: which brain, with what hands.

The front page's typed chat is Jarvis with a keyboard — the same harness the
microphone drives — but the person picks the provider, the model and the
reasoning effort for THAT chat in its composer, and that pick must not move
the live brain the voice runs on. The first attempt at this (2026-08-24)
called ``BrainManager.switch`` and ``apply_provider_model`` per chat turn,
which changed the voice brain as a side effect and was reverted. This is the
replacement: a value object the caller hands to ``generate(turn_override=…)``,
carried in a ContextVar for the length of that one turn, read where the
manager builds its provider chain, its tool surface and its dispatcher —
and nowhere else. The manager's own state (``_active_name``, the provider
config, the dead-lists, the shared brain cache) is never written by it.

Import-light on purpose: ``jarvis.agent_chat`` builds these without pulling
the manager in, and the manager imports this module at the top level.

    """The pick for one ``generate`` call.

    ``provider`` / ``model``
        The chain is exactly this pair — no cross-provider fallback: a person
        who picked a model must get that model or an honest error, never a
        silent stand-in. When the pick cannot call tools at all (a text-only
        brain), the manager's intelligent-router lead still runs in front of
        it, as it does for a tool-incapable voice brain.
    ``reasoning_effort``
        Forwarded onto every request of the turn; ``None`` keeps the
        provider's default.
    ``tools_extra``
        Merged INTO the turn's tool surface after every gate the manager
        applies (the folder tools of a chat, scoped to its working directory).
    ``tool_filter``
        Applied last; a plan-mode caller keeps the read-only tools only.
    ``tool_context``
        Extra keys for every tool's ``ExecutionContext.config`` this turn —
        the approval surface, the working directory, written delivery.
    ``credential_scope``
        Namespaces the brain instance in the manager's cache so the chat's
        client never shares a resolved credential with the voice brain.
    ``max_turns``
        A loop ceiling for the dispatcher; ``None`` keeps its default.
    ``allow_force_spawn``
        Whether the deterministic force-spawn heuristic may hand the turn to
        a background worker. A chat that IS the worker in its folder says no;
        an explicit "spawn an agent for this" still spawns either way.
    ``system_extra``
        A per-turn addendum to the system prompt, appended after the
        manager's own ``_system_prompt_extra``. Empty leaves the prompt
        byte-identical; a surface with its own briefing sets it for its
        turns only.
    ``loop_control``
        Steering, phase reports and the verification pass for this turn
        (``jarvis/brain/loop_control.py``). ``None`` leaves the tool-use loop
        exactly as it was, which is what voice, tasks and missions get.
