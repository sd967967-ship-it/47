"""Frontier brain resolver for background generation tasks.

Provides ``resolve_frontier_brain(config)``: returns a ``Brain`` instance
that uses the **frontier/deep model of the currently configured primary
provider** — dynamically, without hardcoded model names.

Multi-provider requirement (see memory ``feedback_brain_providers.md``):
background generation tasks (BioGenerator, persona descriptions,
skill authoring) MUST respect the provider chosen by the user.
A user who only has a Gemini API key gets a Gemini bio. A user who has
Claude configured gets Opus. Never hardcode model names such as
``claude-opus-4-8`` directly in code.

Fallback order:

1. ``config.board.bio.override_provider/override_model`` (power-user pin).
2. ``config.brain.sub_jarvis`` (BrainTierConfig — Wave 4 legacy entry,
   still read if jarvis.toml still contains the block; values are used as
   a frontier hint).
3. ``config.brain.primary`` + ``TIER_DEFAULTS_BY_PROVIDER['deep']``
   (implicit default frontier lookup).

If a provider cannot be instantiated (no API key, service down, plugin not
loaded), we fall through all three stages and ultimately through the
``configured_fallbacks`` of the tier config. Only after a complete failure
does ``resolve_frontier_brain`` raise a ``RuntimeError``.

Cache strategy: singleton cache, invalidated on ``ConfigReloaded`` event
(subscriber is registered lazily on the first resolve call).
