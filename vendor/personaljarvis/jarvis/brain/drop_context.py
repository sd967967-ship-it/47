"""Capture dragged-and-dropped OS content as SILENT conversation context.

A user drops files / images / text onto the Jarvis presence (the in-app dock or
the floating overlay). This module is the **shared, surface-agnostic intake**:
it classifies the dropped items, composes one bounded, human-readable context
note, and (for images) returns the multimodal :class:`ImageBlock` payloads so the
brain can later *see* a dropped picture.

**A drop never triggers a brain turn.** The user keeps the normal speaking flow;
``ingest_drop`` hands the content to ``brain.add_dropped_context``, which keeps
the text in the conversation context (history) and parks images for the NEXT real
user turn. Jarvis only reacts when the user next speaks or types — a drop while
idle is remembered for next time, a drop mid-flow joins the running context.

No FastAPI / no Tk imports here — both the web route and the desktop overlay call
this module.
