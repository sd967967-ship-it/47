"""Pydantic config models for the Pre-Thinking Ack Flash-Brain.

Maps the [ack_brain] section of jarvis.toml. Two switches, opposite defaults:

- ``enabled = True`` — the subsystem master. ON by default; it keeps the
  GROUNDED spoken output wired (the per-tool ack and the spawn announcement,
  both emitted only after a real tool call / worker spawn).
- ``preamble_enabled = False`` — the SPECULATIVE pre-thinking preamble. OFF by
  default since 2026-06-21: it fired on every utterance with no grounding in
  the action the deep brain actually took, reached first token at a median
  2.98 s, and was the only spoken output on 22 % of preamble turns.

(This docstring used to claim `enabled = False` / "opt-in until the user turns
it on", which described the pre-2026-06-21 shape and contradicted the field
defaults below.)
