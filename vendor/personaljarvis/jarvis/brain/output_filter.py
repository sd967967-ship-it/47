"""Output filter for the voice path — ``scrub_for_voice``.

Persona mandate phase 1: brain output → TTS path scrubs tool JSON,
stack traces, engineering jargon, self-reference, echo paraphrase, and
filler openers. Regex-only, NO LLM calls (latency-fatal, mandate § "DO NOT").

API:
    from jarvis.brain.output_filter import scrub_for_voice
    result = scrub_for_voice(text, language="de")
    result.cleaned        # scrubbed text, ready for TTS
    result.actions        # ["removed_tool_json", "rephrased_echo", ...]
    result.fallback_used  # True when the entire text was replaced by a standard phrase

Order of operations (stack trace is an early return):

    1. Stack trace → standard phrase, ``fallback_used=True`` (early return)
    2. Markdown strip (``**``, ``##``, ``` ``` ```, leading ``-``/``*``)
    3. Remove tool-call JSON (three forms: fn-call, inline, pure JSON)
    4. Remove self-reference ("Als KI", "Als Sprachmodell", "Ich bin nur")
    5. Echo paraphrase ONLY at opener position (``<= OPENER_BUDGET = 60`` chars)
    6. Remove filler openers ("Great question", "Wonderful question", ...)
    7. Remove engineering jargon (with whitelist protection via hyphen
       lookbehind/lookahead — compounds like "Browser-Provider" are preserved)
    8. Normalise whitespace

Failure mode 6 (mandate): echo paraphrase ONLY at opener position. Sometimes
the user genuinely wants an echo-style confirmation ("Du moechtest also den
Termin verschieben? Ja oder nein?") — that must not be destroyed.
