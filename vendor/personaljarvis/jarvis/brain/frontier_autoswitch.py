"""Frontier auto-switch — at boot Hauptjarvis checks whether newer models are
available and switches automatically (user mandate 2026-04-28).

Procedure:
1. Resolver queries /v1/models per Hauptjarvis provider (claude-api, gemini,
   openai). The former Sub-Jarvis tier (Wave-4 migration: removed) is
   explicitly excluded.
2. If new model > old model: mutate ``BrainProviderConfig`` in place
   (Pydantic ``extra="allow"`` permits mutation).
3. Emit a ``FrontierModelSwitched`` event on the bus.
4. Record the switch in the ``_pending_switches`` list — the frontend shows a
   modal, the user clicks OK -> POST /api/frontier/ack -> list cleared.

No smoke-test in the boot path: that would cost 4 additional API round-trips
(1 per provider) and delay boot by 1-2 s. If the new model is broken, the first
brain call will fail and the existing fallback mechanism (RateLimitTracker,
dead-providers) kicks in.
