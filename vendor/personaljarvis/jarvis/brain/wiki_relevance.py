"""Relevance gate for personal-memory context injection.

Deterministic, LLM-free, IO-free guard that decides whether a turn should
consult the personal memory (the wiki vault) at all, and
which retrieved hits are strong enough to be worth putting in front of the
model. Pure regex + set arithmetic — no disk, no network, no provider call
(AP-9/AP-11), so it is safe on the voice critical path and costs microseconds.

Why this exists
---------------
Retrieval has no null element. A similarity or keyword search always returns a
ranked list; "most similar" never means "similar enough". Injecting whatever
came back turns every unrelated question into a personalized non-sequitur —
the model sees a context block in its prompt and assumes it is meant to be
used. The observed failure mode: a general-knowledge question ("what is the
tallest tower in the world?") retrieves an unrelated personal note and the
answer arrives welded to the user's belongings.

Three independent layers, each useful on its own:

1. :func:`should_consult_memory` — BEFORE retrieval. Retrieval-first since the
   2026-08-04 recall audit (a whole two-day live log without a single injected
   turn): the local FTS search costs single-digit milliseconds, so refusing to
   even LOOK was pure loss. Only sub-``_MIN_TOKENS`` fragments still skip.
   Every other turn searches; what the verdict now decides is HOW STRICT the
   post-retrieval filter is. Explicit recollection, planning and personal
   lookups keep the standard coverage bar; world-knowledge-shaped and
   anchor-less turns get a STRICT bar (``strict=True`` →
   :data:`DEFAULT_STRICT_MIN_COVERAGE`), so the tallest-tower case stays
   uninjected not because nobody looked but because nothing retrieved covers
   the question.
2. :func:`relevant_hits` — AFTER retrieval. Coverage of the question's content
   terms plus a within-call relative floor. Deliberately NOT an absolute score
   threshold: ``SearchHit.score`` is documented as comparable only within a
   single call, so a fixed cutoff would be noise. Coverage counts only
   non-stopword terms — a generic question verb ("heisst", "called") in the
   denominator once made the bar unreachable for real German questions.
3. :func:`frame_context_block` — AT injection. The block states what it is and
   grants explicit permission to ignore it, instead of arriving as bare text
   the model reads as an instruction.

Policy note — a WRONG injection is still the worse failure, but the defense
is the strict coverage bar plus the framing contract, no longer a refusal to
search. The router brain additionally holds the ``wiki-recall`` tool and can
look something up deliberately when the injected context is not enough.

Languages: the matcher carries de/en/es tokens as equal peers (CLAUDE.md §1
closed-list item 3 — speech-recognition input vocabulary, matching data rather
than prose). Input is case-, umlaut- and accent-folded before matching, so
the German and Spanish spellings of a word reach the same pattern whether or
not the speech recogniser produced its diacritics.
