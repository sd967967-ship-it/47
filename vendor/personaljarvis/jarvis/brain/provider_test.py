"""Live provider connectivity test — the honest "does this provider actually
answer?" check behind the API-Keys "Test" button.

The desktop API-Keys view shows a green "configured" badge whenever a key STRING
is present in the credential store. That badge says nothing about whether the
provider answers: a stored-but-invalid key, an out-of-credits account, or a
missing model all look identical to "configured". This module makes a REAL,
minimal call through the exact plugin the app uses and classifies the outcome
into an honest status that separates an *integration* problem (broken code /
unreachable) from an *account* state (invalid key / no credits / not set).

``classify_provider_error`` is the pure, message-string core (kept regex-only,
no SDK imports, so it works uniformly across the Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible/
Gemini/httpx error shapes). ``PROVIDER_TEST_STATUSES`` is the single source of
truth for the status vocabulary; the Pydantic ``Literal`` and the TS union
mirror it (anti-drift, BUG-008 class).
