"""Tool-surface fingerprint + self-heal reconcile for the BrainManager.

The BrainManager's tool snapshot is refreshed event-driven: a CLI, plugin, or
MCP source that connects publishes ``BrainToolsChanged`` and the manager
reloads. Event-driven alone is fragile — a source that becomes ready AFTER the
last refresh of a boot, or whose completion event is lost (a wedged plugin
bootstrap, live 2026-07-13), leaves the snapshot stale for the WHOLE session.
The model then refuses with "tool not available" while the very same request
works after the next restart — the intermittent-availability bug class.

``maybe_reconcile_tool_surface`` runs at the head of every turn: it compares a
cheap names-only fingerprint of the live sources (in-process caches, no IO, no
LLM — AP-11 safe) against the fingerprint stamped at the last tool load, and
triggers one ``refresh_tools()`` on drift. Whatever upstream event went
missing, the tool surface converges at the next turn.
