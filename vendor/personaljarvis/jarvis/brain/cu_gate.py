"""Deterministic explicit-desktop gate for LLM-chosen computer_use calls.

Live incident 2026-07-21 11:36 (voice session 06a65611): the user asked a pure
knowledge question — "braucht die Golf 100 Start- und  # i18n-allow: forensic quote
Landebahn" (what runway does the Gulfstream G100 need)  # i18n-allow: quote cont.
— the realtime layer correctly delegated the turn to the router brain, and the
router brain then called ``computer_use``: it physically opened Safari on the
user's screen and typed "Gulfstream G100 runway requirements" into Google.
A web lookup the tool model can do invisibly (own knowledge or ``search_web``)
hijacked the user's live desktop for ~35 seconds.

This is the spawn-gate lesson applied to the desktop (see
``jarvis/brain/spawn_gate.py``, maintainer mandate 2026-07-18): a tool
description is advice, not enforcement. This module is the enforcement. An
LLM-initiated ``computer_use`` call executes ONLY when one of these holds:

1. The CURRENT user turn explicitly names the desktop vehicle — an on-screen
   action verb ("open", "click", "type", "scroll", ...) or a screen/app/
   browser noun ("Chrome", "terminal", "Bildschirm",  # i18n-allow: vocab token
   ...), in any supported language. Matching *input vocabulary*, not prose —
   deliberately word-based, mirroring the spawn gate.
2. The conversation is still inside a desktop episode: a Computer-Use mission
   is active or finished within the follow-up window
   (``cu_run_registry.has_recent_run``). This keeps the BUG-105 corrective
   follow-ups alive ("try again", "do it in my Chrome browser" — the latter
   also matches rule 1) without letting a cold research question start one.

**Looking is not operating (maintainer mandate 2026-08-02).** A surface NOUN is
not a command: "what is on my screen?" names the screen without asking for
anything to be done to it, and it used to pass rule 1 on the bare noun alone —
so a question that Screen Context answers with one screenshot instead started a
desktop mission that moved the user's mouse. The vocabulary is therefore split
into ACTION verbs and SURFACE nouns, and a turn that
``jarvis.screen_context.intent`` reads as a look request is refused even when it
names a surface and even inside a live desktop episode. Only an action verb, an
explicitly named Computer-Use, or a surface noun in a turn that is NOT a look
request may still drive the desktop. This gate is where the boundary is
actually enforced: it decides on the USER's words, so a look request is refused
even inside a live episode. A successful Screen Context capture additionally
narrows the turn's surface (``BrainManager.generate``) — the spawn vehicles and
the deterministic record writes go, the read tools and ``computer_use`` stay.
Until 2026-08-17 that capture stripped EVERY tool, which also left the action
half of a mixed utterance ("look here, close that window") with no vehicle at
all; the narrowing keeps the boundary and gives that half its vehicle back.

Everything else is blocked and fed back to the model as a tool error telling
it to answer inline (or via ``search_web`` for fresh facts). Over-ALLOWING is
safe by construction — a match only means the MODEL MAY drive the desktop, it
never forces it. The deterministic local-action fast path
(``jarvis/brain/local_action_gate.py``) does NOT run through this gate — it
already fires only on explicit action grammar.

Consumers: ``jarvis.brain.tool_use_loop`` (classic pipeline + realtime
delegate mode) and ``jarvis.realtime.tools`` (realtime direct tool mode).
