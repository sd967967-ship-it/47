"""The model slots Ollama fills, read and written from ONE place.

Today the local brain is spread over four config keys the user never sees
side by side: the chat model, the voice model (the managed voice server's
brain, baked into its launch command), the tool/screen model and the deep
model — plus two read-only consumers (the quick ack, dictation polish) that
pin their own tag. The wiki's embedding slot was retired with the UltraWiki
semantic memory (2026-08-28); nothing embeds locally any more.
This module names every slot as a :class:`RoleSpec`, reads its current pick
from a loaded config, judges which INSTALLED downloads qualify for it (by the
capabilities ``/api/show`` declares) and recommends one, so the "Local
models" section can show the four rows with one button each instead of four
different pickers in four different views.

The recommendation is INSTALLED FIRST: the best qualifying download already
on the server — the largest one that fits this machine's memory, with the
role's preferred capabilities — and only when nothing installed qualifies
does the curated shortlist's pick (a download) stand in. A user with eleven
models on disk is told which of them to use, not sent to the catalogue.

Writing goes through the existing config writers only
(``config_writer.set_brain_provider_model``), so a role change lands in
``jarvis.toml`` AND the drift baseline exactly like a pick made on the
provider card — the drift guard sees no difference (AP-7,
BUG-010 class). The tier defaults stay ``""`` (= plugin-side discovery);
nothing here pins a model by default.
