"""Brain factory: delivers a `BrainCallback` (async (str) -> str) for the pipeline.

The factory is the only authorised entry point for Phase-1b launchers
(`speech/pipeline.py` + `speech/watchdog.py`). It attempts in order:

1. **BrainManager** (Phase 5.5, tier-aware) — Router tier (Haiku) or sub tier (Opus).
2. **GeminiTestBrain** — Phase-1b fallback if BrainManager is missing/crashed.
3. **Echo** — last resort so the pipeline does not die completely.

The factory is therefore **drop-in-compatible**: regardless of which brain level
loads, the pipeline always receives something that can `async def __call__(text) -> str`.

# Router-tier: pure-dispatcher set (grown via documented ADR-0011 amendments;
# the exact-match regression test pins the current membership) plus three
# self-mod tools (Phase 7.3, registered separately in the loader). See
# ``router.py:SYSTEM_PROMPT`` and ADR-0011 (including the Phase-7/8 amendment
# + Wave-4 amendment ``spawn-sub-jarvis`` -> ``spawn-worker``) and
# Master-Plan §22 / Persona-Mandate Phase 3.
#
# Baseline after the 2026-07-13 cleanup: run-shell, screen-snapshot, and
# spawn-worker. The legacy dispatch-to-harness, multi-spawn, and
# dispatch-with-review paths are deliberately not model-visible because each
# duplicated or bypassed the supervised Mission Manager lifecycle.
#
# REMOVED 2026-06-28 — ``dispatch-to-harness`` is intentionally NOT a
# LLM-visible router tool. Its raw ``harness`` parameter let the brain request
# a sub-agent vehicle by NAME (``harness="openclaw"``), but that value is not a
# registered harness (Wave-4 removal, ~92% hang). The operational harness
# inventory now contains only python-script and the capability-gated screenshot
# adapter. A "start a
# subagent" turn then dispatched to a phantom harness and surfaced the raw
# "Harness 'openclaw' nicht verfügbar" KeyError to voice.  # i18n-allow
# Heavy Jarvis-Agent work is ``spawn-worker`` (Mission Manager → worker);
# live desktop work
# is ``computer-use``. The tool class itself still exists for the INTERNAL,
# non-LLM local-action fast path (see ``_load_local_action_tools``, called
# programmatically with harness="screenshot"); it is just not router-selectable.
# Do NOT re-add it here — that resurrects the phantom-harness routing bug.
#
# Rationale: Hauptjarvis is a pure dispatcher. Direct actions outside this
# list (open_app, type_text, remember, whoami …) are delegated to a background
# worker — the router delegates them via ``spawn_worker``. Read-only lookups
# (search-web, wiki-recall, awareness-recall) and safe-gated direct actions
# (computer-use, cli-tools, plugin-tools) are router-tier by design — see the
# ADR-0011 amendments (2026-05-24 CLI, 2026-05-29 Computer-Use, 2026-06-01
# plugins, 2026-06-10 inline web search).
# This prevents the spawn-reflex behaviour documented in
# ``docs/persona-research.md`` Section 2 and keeps the tool set deterministic.
