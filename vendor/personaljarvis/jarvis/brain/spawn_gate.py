"""Deterministic explicit-delegation gate for LLM-chosen agent spawns.

Maintainer mandate 2026-07-18 (voice sessions 08:25 + 08:29): the model kept
starting background agents mid-conversation ("... he could buy a Gulfstream
every day", "I want to figure out where to move next") although the user never
asked for one. Every prior fix was prompt-side (router SPAWN-CRITERIA, the
realtime role directives, the spawn_worker tool description) — and the model
kept ignoring it, because a tool description is advice, not enforcement.

This module is the enforcement. An LLM-initiated spawn tool call executes
ONLY when one of these holds:

1. The CURRENT user turn explicitly requests delegation — it names the agent
   vehicle ("agent", "subagent", "<wake-name> Agent", "worker", "mission",
   "openclaw") or a delegation verb/marker ("spawn", "delegate", "in the
   background"), in any supported language. Matching *input vocabulary*, not
   prose — deliberately word-based (the router's force-spawn triggers work the
   same way).
2. The turn is a short, clear YES to a delegation offer the model made right
   after the gate blocked the previous turn (the model is told to offer
   instead of spawn; the user's confirmation then unlocks exactly one spawn).
3. The EFFORT test (``effort_warrants_delegation``) reads the turn as a
   request for a multi-step artefact — a build/write/refactor brief, or
   research whose deliverable is a file. Added on the maintainer mandate
   2026-08-18 ("the goal is that he just DOES things without being told"),
   because rules 1 and 2 meant Jarvis could never start work on its own
   judgement: "Bau mir eine Website mit Flask und einer Startseite" produced
   an offer, never a website. Available in the ``balanced`` and ``permissive``
   force-spawn modes, OFF in ``strict`` — see ``jarvis.core.config``.

Everything else is blocked and fed back to the model as a tool error telling
it to answer inline. The deterministic force-spawn path
(``BrainManager._should_force_spawn``) does NOT run through this gate — it
already fires only on explicit trigger phrases in strict mode and carries its
own decline/negation guards.

Consumers: ``jarvis.brain.tool_use_loop`` (classic pipeline + realtime
delegate mode) and ``jarvis.realtime.tools`` (realtime direct tool mode).
Both share the ONE module-level offer window because both feed the same
single conversation per process; a mode switch keeps the pending offer.

# The EFFORT route (maintainer mandate 2026-08-18)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The vocabulary route above asks "did the user name the vehicle?". This one
# asks "is the WORK itself plainly a multi-step artefact?" — a build / write /
# refactor brief, or research whose deliverable is a file. A question, a
# lookup, a chat turn and anything cheap stay inline, as before.
#
# The direction of error is NOT symmetric here, and the whole test is built
# around that asymmetry: an unrequested background agent is expensive,
# surprising and hard to stop (forensic 2026-05-01 — the model hallucinated a
# spawn on the chit-chat turn "es geht ab" and Jarvis then claimed to have
# started tests it never started), while a missed delegation costs one inline
# answer plus the offer the model is told to make. So every stage is
# conjunctive and EVERY doubt resolves to "no spawn":
#
#   1. REQUEST SHAPE   the turn must be an order or a request TO Jarvis — not
#                      a report of finished work, not an information question.
#   2. NOT CHEAP       an explicit small-scope word ("kurz", "quick", "nur",
#                      "einfach") vetoes outright.
#   3. NOT CONVERSATION the manager's existing stand-down detectors
#                      (instructional / opinion / coaching) veto; reused rather
#                      than re-decided, so the effort route cannot drift away
#                      from the force-spawn path.
#   4. DELIVERABLE     a build verb + an artefact noun, a named file, or a
#                      code-work verb + a code object.

#                      components, an explicit multi-step marker, or a research
#                      verb next to the deliverable) AND two signals in total.
#
# Where the "unsure" line sits: stage 5. One signal is not enough. "Bau mir
# eine Website" names one component and stops — the model answers inline and
# may offer. "Bau mir eine Website mit Flask und einer Startseite" carries two
# components, a specification and a coordination: three signals, so it goes.

# All matching is pure regex over the user's own words (AP-11 safe, no LLM in
