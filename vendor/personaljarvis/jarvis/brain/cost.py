"""Cost pricing for brain providers (USD per 1M tokens).

Three sources, in this order (see :func:`resolve_rates`):

1. ``PRICING_USD_PER_MTOK`` — the static table below, hand-verified against
   the vendors' own price pages. Authoritative for models called through
   their ORIGIN API (Anthropic, Google/Vertex, OpenAI, xAI, DeepSeek …).
2. The provider feed cached by ``jarvis/brain/model_catalog.py``
   (``data/model_catalog_cache.json``). OpenRouter's ``/api/v1/models``
   publishes a price for every model it routes, so a ``vendor/model`` id is
   priced from the feed FIRST (that is what OpenRouter actually bills), and
   an origin id the table has never heard of falls back to the feed entry
   with the same model name (``gemini-3.7-flash`` → ``google/gemini-3.7-flash``)
   — an honest approximation instead of $0.00.
3. Nothing → 0.0, and the caller logs it.

The static table alone shipped every new model generation as "free" until
someone noticed (1.87M deepseek tokens in 2026-07, gemini-3.7-flash in
2026-08). :func:`ensure_pricing_for` closes that gap at runtime: an unknown
model triggers ONE feed refresh per process before it is priced.

Static table as of 2026-08-18. Sources:

- Anthropic — https://www.anthropic.com/pricing
  (Claude Opus 4.x: $15 in / $75 out, Sonnet 4.x: $3 / $15, Haiku 4.5: $0.80 / $4)
- Google — https://ai.google.dev/pricing
  (Gemini 2.5 Pro: $1.25 / $10, Gemini 2.5 Flash: $0.30 / $2.50,
   Gemini 3.6/3.7 Flash: $0.75 / $3.75)
- OpenAI — https://openai.com/api/pricing
  (GPT-4o: $2.50 / $10, GPT-4o-mini: $0.15 / $0.60)
- xAI / Grok — https://console.x.ai/pricing
  (Grok-3: $5 / $15, Grok-4.1-fast: $0.40 / $1.60,
   Grok-4.3: $1.25 / $2.50 — doubles above 200k input)
- DeepSeek — https://platform.deepseek.com/api-docs/pricing
  (deepseek-chat: $0.27 / $1.10, deepseek-reasoner: $0.55 / $2.19)

If a model is missing here AND in the feed, ``calculate_cost_usd`` returns
0.0 — no crash, but also no cost tracking. Logging at the call site is
mandatory so that missing entries become visible rather than silently
turning into a "free" banner.

Only the three short names a coding CLI accepts on its command line
(``sonnet`` / ``opus`` / ``haiku``) are mapped, in ``MODEL_ALIASES``: mission
workers are spawned with exactly those, and 64 drafts holding 1.78M tokens
sat unpriced because "sonnet" matched nothing (2026-08-25). Every other
caller passes the canonical id. PROVIDER_ALIASES in ``manager.py`` is for
provider names, not model IDs.
