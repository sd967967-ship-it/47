"""In-app model downloads for a local Ollama server.

CLAUDE.md section 3 requires a capability to be recoverable from INSIDE the
app. The local brain card missed that bar in the one place it matters most:
with a running server and no downloads, every path failed with "run: ollama
pull <model>" — a terminal instruction in a desktop app with no terminal, and
the point where a keyless install stops being usable at all.

This module is the brain-side twin of :mod:`jarvis.speech.local_install`: a
curated shortlist of pulls, an honest size/fit verdict against the machine's
actual memory, and a background download whose progress the UI polls. The
server does the work — ``POST /api/pull`` streams NDJSON progress lines — so
nothing here needs a package manager or elevated rights.

Two deliberate choices:

* **Curated names are a starting point, never a gate.** Model names in the
  Ollama library drift (tags come and go), so any name may be pulled, and a
  name the registry does not know produces an honest "not in the library"
  message pointing at ollama.com/library rather than a silent failure.
* **Fit is advisory, never a block.** The memory verdict uses total RAM and a
  rule of thumb; a GPU box runs models the rule calls tight. It informs the
  choice — it does not forbid one (the maintainer's box is not the baseline).
