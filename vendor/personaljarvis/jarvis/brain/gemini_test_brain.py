"""Fictitious test brain based on Gemini (for speech-pipeline validation only).

This is NOT a production brain plugin (the real brain plugins in
`jarvis/plugins/brain/` build a different instance). This is a simple
`BrainCallback` that exercises the pipeline hook with something that behaves
like a real LLM — so the user can test the entire system end-to-end.

Model-ID fallback: tries `gemini-3.1-pro` first, then older stable models,
then Flash. The first model that responds wins.
