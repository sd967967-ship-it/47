"""User-editable agent-instructions file — an ``AGENTS.md`` / ``CLAUDE.md`` equivalent.

This is the user's own standing-instructions file: free-text Markdown where the
user writes personal preferences for *how the assistant should treat them* — tone,
language, formatting, default choices, standing facts. It is deliberately distinct
from the packaged persona (``JARVIS_PERSONA.md`` / ``data/custom_system_prompt.md``,
handled by ``persona_loader``), which defines *who the assistant is and what it may
do*. Preferences refine behaviour; they never override safety rules, confirmation
gates, or capabilities.

The file is named after the assistant: assistant "Ruben" -> ``Ruben.md``. The name
is resolved through :func:`jarvis.brain.assistant_name.resolve_assistant_name`
(the wake phrase with its prefix stripped, else the neutral ``Assistant`` fallback —
there is no longer a separate ``[persona].name`` setting) and sanitised to a
filesystem-safe basename. The
file lives in its own directory under ``DATA_DIR`` so that a rename can be tracked
unambiguously: when the assistant is renamed, the next read migrates the single
existing file to the new name (no content is lost on a rebrand).

Mirrors the ``persona_loader`` custom-prompt seam:

* atomic write (tempfile + ``os.replace``), UTF-8 **without** a BOM, ``newline="\n"``
  — the AP-7 / BUG-018 defenses;
* read **fresh** every call (no cache) so an edit takes effect on the next turn
  with no restart — ``_build_system_prompt`` reassembles each turn anyway;
* every path helper reads ``core_config.DATA_DIR`` at call time (never bound at
  import) so the path is CWD-immune (the onboarding-reappears bug class) and tests
  can redirect ``DATA_DIR``.
