"""Iteration budget: limits per conversation turn.

Two parallel limits:
- `max_turns`: number of allowed tool-use loops (prevents infinite loops). This
  is the hard iteration bound.
- `max_tokens_total`: ceiling on the tokens the loop *generates* (output),
  guarding against runaway generation.

`tokens_used` counts OUTPUT tokens only — NOT the re-sent prompt. The prompt
(system + tool schemas + the full conversation history) is re-sent on every
turn and grows with the conversation; counting it here let a single
large-context turn exhaust the whole loop budget and abort a pending tool call
before execution (live bug 2026-06-01: "Einen Moment." then silence in a long
voice session — an AD-OE6 silent drop). The re-sent prompt is bounded by
`max_turns` × the context window, so `max_turns` is the cost/loop guard; this
ceiling catches genuine runaway *generation*.

Both are *soft hints* — the API may exceed them by up to ~10% mid-callback. We
therefore combine a hard count with a soft check.
