"""Bus wildcard subscriber that writes voice sessions into the SessionStore.

Architecture decision: read-only with respect to the pipeline. The recorder
only docks on via ``bus.subscribe_all`` and produces no events back —
which guarantees it is latency-neutral for the voice hot path.

State machine per session (linear, since the pipeline allows only 1 active
voice session):

                                       | TranscriptFinal / final

                                    ACTIVE  (next turn possible)

Whitelist for the ``voice_events`` append: not every bus event lands in
the DB — TerminalOutput streams or MissionEvents are irrelevant.
