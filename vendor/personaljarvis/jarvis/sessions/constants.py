"""Single source of truth for voice-session enum-like values.

Why this module exists
======================

BUG-008 occurred twice (2026-05-03, 2026-05-05). Each time the root cause
was the same: a hangup_reason string was added to the runtime path
(``speech/pipeline.py`` or ``sessions/init.py``) without also being added
to the Pydantic ``HangupReason`` Literal in ``models.py``. The first
list-API request that returned a session with the new value validated
against the Literal, raised ``ValidationError``, FastAPI converted that
to HTTP 500, and the UI showed an empty state.

By exporting a single tuple here and importing symbolic constants at
every call site, three things become impossible:

1. A typo at the call site (``"turn_complte"`` would pass the Literal
   check today; it cannot pass an attribute lookup).
2. Adding a runtime value without surfacing it to readers of this
   module — the tuple is the contract.
3. Asymmetric drift between Python and TypeScript — the parity test
   in ``tests/unit/sessions/test_hangup_reason_parity.py`` reads
   ``HANGUP_REASONS`` and compares against the TS / TSX / SQL layers.

If you find yourself wanting to write a new hangup-reason string at a
call site: add the constant here first, regenerate the Literal in
``models.py`` (manual mirror — see comment there), then use the symbol.

classic pipeline (no realtime provider could open a session, or the duplex
stream died before any turn was committed).

This marks a handover, NOT an end: the pipeline keeps the same ``session_id``
running and publishes the one real ``VoiceSessionEnded`` when the call actually
finishes. ``RealtimeVoiceSession.end`` therefore stops here without announcing a
session end — treating the handover as one froze the JarvisBar mid-call and
closed the recorder row with ``turns=0`` (live 2026-07-26). It stays in
``HANGUP_REASONS`` because rows written before that fix still carry it, so the
session list must keep a label for them."""
