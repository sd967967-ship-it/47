"""SQLite store for voice sessions (sync, WAL mode).

Unlike ``jarvis/missions/event_store.py`` (aiosqlite, async),
this store runs synchronously with ``sqlite3`` + ``threading.Lock``.
Rationale: the ``SessionRecorder`` is called from EventBus subscriber
callbacks; depending on the event this happens from the asyncio loop
OR from a worker thread (the pipeline is multi-threaded). A
synchronous store with a lock is the simplest path without loop-detection
hacks. SQLite writes are in the µs range, and lock contention is
unmeasurable on a voice path with < 100 events/sec.

Atomicity: WAL + ``synchronous=NORMAL`` flushes writes to disk;
an event can be lost between a process crash and the bus publish
- acceptable for voice sessions (a non-critical UI feature).

Cleanup: ``prune_older_than(days)`` deletes old sessions; ON DELETE
CASCADE in schema.sql cleans up turns + events automatically along with it.
