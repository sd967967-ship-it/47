"""Pydantic models for voice-session recording.

Three layers mapping 1:1 to the SQLite schema (schema.sql):

- ``VoiceSessionRow``  - header row per session.
- ``VoiceTurnRow``     - aggregate per turn (user+Jarvis).
- ``VoiceEventRow``    - raw event from the bus, for detail replay.

Plus composite DTOs for the REST API (``SessionListItem``,
``SessionDetail``).

Convention: ``_ms`` = wall-clock timestamp in milliseconds since epoch
(matches existing Phase-6 mission events). The frontend converts this
to ISO strings itself — the backend stays with the numeric form.

# BUG-008 (three episodes 2026-05-03 / -05 / -10): the Pydantic ``Literal``
# broke the list-sessions API every time the pipeline introduced a new
# ``hangup_reason`` string (most recently ``turn_complete`` from
# pipeline.py:1391). So: no more ``Literal``, instead an open ``str``
# plus a **documenting** constant with the values known today.
# Drift detection happens in the test (see ``tests/unit/sessions/
# test_models_db_drift.py``), not in the Pydantic validator — otherwise
# the UI collapses on every new value.
