"""TaskAutoApprover — unattended pre-authorization for scheduled-task tools.

A scheduled "agent" task pre-authorizes specific plugins at creation time by
toggling them with a ``write``/``full`` permission scope. While that task's
turn runs, an ask-tier tool call (e.g. "post a tweet", "send an email")
would normally block at ``ApprovalWorkflow.wait()`` because no human is
present to confirm. This bridge answers that gate programmatically — but
only for tools the task was explicitly granted, and only for that task's
own ``trace_id``.

Design (Option B from the integration analysis):
  - The runner ``arm()``s the bridge with the turn's ``trace_id`` and the
    set of pre-authorized plugin ids before running the turn, then
    ``disarm()``s in a finally.
  - The bridge listens for ``ActionApprovalRequired``. On a match (same trace_id +
    the proposed tool belongs to a granted plugin) it publishes
    ``ActionApproved`` straight onto the bus, which resolves the executor's
    ``wait()``. The full audit trail (Proposed -> Approved -> Executed) is
    preserved — this answers the gate, it does not bypass it.
  - Anything NOT armed (read-only grants arm with an empty set; ungranted
    tools) is left to block and deny on timeout. Nothing is auto-approved
    by default.

Concurrency-safe: a persistent ``ActionApprovalRequired`` subscriber plus a
``trace_id -> grant`` map, so several tasks can run at once without a
per-turn subscribe/unsubscribe race.
