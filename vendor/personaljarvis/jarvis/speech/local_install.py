"""In-app installation of the optional local speech engines and their models.

CLAUDE.md section 3 is explicit that a capability must be recoverable from
INSIDE the app: entering, switching or repairing a provider may never require
hand-editing ``jarvis.toml`` or dropping to a shell. A local provider makes that
concrete — it needs a pip package and a multi-gigabyte model download before it
can transcribe a word, and telling a non-developer to run pip is exactly the
"works on my machine" failure §3 exists to prevent.

Two halves, tracked separately because they fail separately and are fixed
differently:

* the **engine** (a pip install, needs a wheel for this Python/OS),
* the **model** (a download into the HuggingFace cache or the data dir).

The work runs on a daemon thread and reports progress through a small state
dict the UI polls, because a synchronous route would hold a request open for
minutes and a failed install must stay RETRYABLE rather than raising into a
500. Every terminal state carries an English sentence saying what happened —
never a bare boolean (AP-30).
