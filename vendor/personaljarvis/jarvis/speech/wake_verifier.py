"""Post-detection prefix verifier for the OpenWakeWord wake path.

A neural wake model generalises onto near-misses of its phrase (historically:
a bare core word fired the full-phrase model — BUG-009). Pendulum-style
threshold edits have been forbidden by ``tests/unit/speech/test_wake_threshold``
since BUG-009 episode 5. The clean fix is a second-stage check: when OWW
fires, transcribe the few seconds preceding the hit with the cloud STT that
the rest of the voice path already uses (Groq by default) and require the
configured phrase's matcher to confirm the transcript before activating.

The matcher is the *same* object the heavy ``RollingWhisperWake`` backstop
uses (the wake plan's compiled phrase matcher), so the two wake paths can
never drift apart (BUG-008 territory).
