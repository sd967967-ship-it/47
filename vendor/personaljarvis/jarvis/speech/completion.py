"""Incomplete-prompt completion classifier — structural twin of ``hangup.py``.

A deterministic, stdlib-only detector that decides whether a *finalized* voice
transcript is syntactically open-ended ("Erinnere mich morgen daran, dass" …
silence) and should be held for a continuation, rather than answered.

Design contract (see
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-25-incomplete-prompt-completion-design.md``):

* **Precision over recall / "answer when in doubt".** A complete prompt must
  NEVER be held back. We fire ONLY on a closed, curated set of trailing tokens
  that practically never end a complete sentence.
* **No dictionary, no morphology.** The hard German ambiguity — a separable verb
  prefix that is spelled like a stranded preposition ("Ruf Tom *an*" is complete;
  "Schick die Mail *an*" is dangling) — is not *resolved*, it is *avoided*: every
  ambiguous token (``an/auf/mit/ab/zu/aus/vor/nach/über/durch/von/in/um/unter``)
  is simply absent from every fire-list, so both sentences return ``None``. We
  knowingly miss the genuine dangling case to guarantee zero false holds.
* **English strands prepositions grammatically** ("What's it *for*?"), so the
  English path fires only on conjunctions and determiners, never on a bare
  trailing preposition.
* **``der/die/das`` are excluded** — they are article *or* demonstrative pronoun
  ("Mach *das*" is complete), so only unambiguous noun-requiring determiners fire.

Standard-library only (``re``, ``dataclasses``). Like ``hangup.py`` it must stay
free of ``sounddevice`` and any heavy import so it can run cheaply on the voice
critical path.

# hallucinated a screen description. STT emits a trailing ellipsis ("..." or the
