"""Rolling-window Whisper wake detection — robust wake without a VAD dependency.

Unlike `whisper_wake.py` (which waits for a VAD endpoint and fails on quiet
mics): here a 2.5-second ring buffer of audio is held and transcribed by
Whisper every 500 ms. If "jarvis" shows up in the transcript — trigger.

Advantages:
- No VAD dependency → also works at a low mic level
- Triggers immediately (500 ms polling interval), not only after speech ends
- Uses Whisper (natively German-capable) → no English-training bias

Disadvantages:
- Higher GPU load (Whisper runs continuously instead of only at utterance end)
- On an RTX 5070 Ti with distil-large-v3: ~80-150 ms per 2.5-second transcription
  = ~20 % GPU usage at a 500 ms poll interval

Parameters:
- `window_s`: buffer length (default 2.5 s — long enough for "Hey Jarvis")
- `poll_interval_s`: how often we transcribe (default 0.5 s)
- `cooldown_s`: don't trigger again immediately after a trigger (default 2 s)

# Fable' transcribed at window rms 0.0036-0.0043 — below idle hiss — with nobody
# speaking; the same silent windows also produced random hallucinations like
# 'my own great wrist music.'). The strict phrase matcher cannot help (the text

# carrying extra invented words, and it fails OPEN when its second STT pass
# errors. The physical discriminator is energy — a genuine spoken wake carries a
# real speech burst whose window rms clears this floor, while a
# silence-hallucination sits at the noise floor. This mirrors the OpenWakeWord
# path's ``CUSTOM_WAKE_MIN_RMS`` silence gate.
#
# Bounds (data-derived — do NOT raise above the quiet-mic recall contract): the
# observed silence-ghost cluster tops out at rms 0.0043 and idle hiss at
# ~0.0046, while a genuine QUIET wake is pinned at window rms ~0.009 by
# tests/unit/speech/test_rolling_whisper_wake_quiet_mic.py. 0.006 sits cleanly

# there. Below this level the confirm still runs (the borderline band, where a
# quiet primed hallucination is plausible). This roughly halves wake latency on
# a normal, clearly-spoken wake — every genuine wake in the live log peaked at
# rms 0.027-0.12, well above this bar. Silence is handled earlier and more

        Ghost-activation forensic (live log 2026-07-02, five activations in
        ~30 min with media audio in the room): the wake Whisper is primed with
        ``initial_prompt="<phrase>"`` so the weak model resolves ambiguous
        noise/breath windows to EXACTLY the primed text — transcript
        ``'Hey Fable'`` at rms 0.0037, verbatim, no surrounding words. The
        strict matcher cannot help: the text IS the full phrase. Removing the
        bias is no fix either (recall collapses 100 % -> 62.5 %, measured).

        The tell-tale is the ECHO SIGNATURE (the transcript consists of the
        phrase and NOTHING else) — genuine speech usually carries context.
        Such candidates get ONE unbiased second pass over the SAME window: an
        unprimed ear hears *something* wherever real speech exists (even a
        mis-hearing), but hears nothing — or a known hallucination
        boilerplate — on the noise the primed model echoed over. Costs one
        extra local transcribe only on exact-phrase candidates. Fail-open on
        infrastructure errors: a broken confirm must never eat a real wake.

        CRITICAL — this must NEVER require the unbiased pass to reproduce the
        wake WORD. The whole reason for the bias prompt is that the unprimed
        base model cannot transcribe a hard proper-noun wake ('Mythos' ->
        'Mütos'/'Mut', 'Fable' -> 'Farbe'); demanding it there rejects EVERY
        genuine wake (live recall-kill 2026-07-02). "Heard any real speech" is
        the only safe test here; the word-agnostic SILENCE guard is the raw
        energy gate at the match site (``_match_min_rms``), not this transcript.
