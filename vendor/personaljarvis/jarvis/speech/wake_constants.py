"""Single source of truth for the configurable wake-word vocabulary.

Pure stdlib — NO ``jarvis.*`` imports, NO heavy third-party imports — so the
matcher module (``wake_phrase``), the Pydantic config (``core/config.py``), and
the tests can all import this without dragging in ``faster_whisper``,
``sounddevice``, or the openWakeWord runtime.

Why this module exists:
- ``WAKE_ENGINES`` is the SoT for the five-layer enum (Python ↔ TOML ↔ Pydantic
  ↔ TS ↔ UI). The TS mirror (``frontend/src/constants/wakeEngines.ts``) is held
  in lockstep by ``tests/unit/speech/test_wake_engine_parity.py``.
- The product ships NO named wake model and never resolves a phrase against a
  pretrained one (design 2026-07-07): every phrase goes through the generic
  engine chain in ``wake_phrase.resolve_wake_plan`` (user-trained custom .onnx
  -> any-word Vosk KWS -> local-Whisper transcript match -> honest degrade).

    Two independent conditions, and BOTH are needed — either one alone gets a
    real utterance deleted:

    * **The recording is short.** Whisper hallucinates on near-silence, so the
      filter only judges recordings too short to hold much else. The audio
      length is the honest measure here (see the callers), not the wall clock.
    * **The boilerplate is the WHOLE utterance.** ``STT_HALLUCINATION_RE``
      matches a substring, which is the right shape for the voice lane — there
      the question is "may this reach the brain". On a transcript the question
      is different: "thank you very much for the update" contains a marker and
      is a sentence the user dictated. So a match is necessary but not
      sufficient; every word of the transcript must also come from the markers'
      own vocabulary. "Thank you for watching!" passes that test (the shared
      pattern spells the outro "thanks for watching", and the vocabulary covers
      the other spelling for free). The same holds in every language the
      pattern carries markers for: a real sentence that merely opens with a
      polite formula survives, because the words after it — "update", a file
      name, a question — are nobody's boilerplate.

    Digits are ignored on purpose: the markers carry years, and a year is not
    what distinguishes a hallucination from a sentence.

    Lives here, in the leaf module beside the pattern itself, because BOTH the
    dictation delivery gate and the realtime input recognizer need the same
    verdict — a second copy would stop agreeing with the first (BUG-008).
