"""ContinuationBuffer — coalesce a fragmented voice task into one brain turn.

Sibling helper of :mod:`jarvis.speech.completion` and :mod:`jarvis.speech.hangup`.
Stdlib-only, deterministic, fail-open. Holds an *open-ended* utterance until the
next utterance arrives, then dispatches the joined text as ONE turn. Prevents
the live regression observed 2026-05-26 12:13 where ONE user task was cut by VAD
into two transcripts at a trailing comma and BOTH halves triggered
``spawn_worker`` separately — producing two sub-agent missions for one task.

Design contract:

* **Precision over recall** (inherited from ``completion.is_incomplete``):
  buffering only happens on a CLOSED set of trailing markers
  (conjunction / determiner / preposition / trailing comma). Complete-looking
  utterances pass through immediately — never silently held back.
* **Bounded chain**: after ``max_chain`` consecutive incomplete pieces the
  buffer flushes anyway. No infinite buffering, no live-locks.
* **Wall-clock timeout**: a stale buffer (no continuation within
  ``timeout_s``) is dropped on the NEXT ``process()`` call so it can't pollute
  an unrelated future turn. Because that drop is *lazy* (it needs a next
  ``process()``), the pipeline also arms an autonomous drain timer that calls
  :meth:`flush_pending` on expiry and DISPATCHES the held fragment to the brain
  — so a held fragment whose continuation never comes is answered, not silently
  dropped at the session idle-timeout (live "Jarvis hört für immer zu" wedge
  2026-06-19, session da25113a).
* **Fail-open** (AD-OE6 zero-silent-drop): any exception from the classifier
  is caught and the utterance is dispatched as-is. The buffer never silently
  swallows the user.

Pipeline wiring lives in ``jarvis.speech.pipeline._handle_utterance`` (+ the
``_arm_continuation_drain`` timer); this module exposes ``process(text,
language)``, ``discard()`` and ``flush_pending()``.
