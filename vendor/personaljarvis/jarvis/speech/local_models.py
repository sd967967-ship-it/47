"""On-disk truth about the OPTIONAL local speech engines and their models.

Why this module exists — the 2026-07-03 lesson. A user-selectable
"Faster-Whisper (local)" STT card already shipped once and had to be REMOVED
(v1.0.1) for two reasons, both of which were the same defect wearing different
clothes: **the UI asserted a readiness nobody had verified.** The card reported
"ready" on a base install where the engine package was never installed, and its
model picker listed every Whisper checkpoint regardless of what had actually
been downloaded. Picking it produced a provider that could not transcribe a
single word.

So the local providers get exactly one gate, and this is it. Nothing may claim a
local engine is usable except by asking here, and every answer separates the two
independent facts a local path needs:

* **engine** — is the inference runtime importable in THIS interpreter
  (``faster_whisper`` / ``sherpa_onnx``)? Both are opt-in extras the cloud-first
  base install deliberately omits (CLAUDE.md section 3), so on a fresh install
  the honest answer is "no".
* **model** — are the weights on disk? An installed engine with no weights is
  not readiness; it is a download away from it, and saying so is the whole
  point.

Design contract, mirroring ``jarvis.setup.model_report``:

- **Read-only and network-free.** Probing must never download: the Whisper probe
  uses ``local_files_only``, the sherpa probe is a directory check. A status
  route polls these, so a probe that reached the network would turn a UI refresh
  into a multi-gigabyte surprise.
- **Best-effort, never raising.** Every probe degrades to "absent". An uncertain
  answer is "not ready" — that is the fail-closed direction, because claiming
  readiness we cannot prove is the exact bug this module exists to prevent.
- **Capability, never hardware or provider names** (AP-21). Nothing here asks
  what GPU is installed or which vendor a provider belongs to.
