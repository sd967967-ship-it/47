"""Eager prefetch of the heavy wake-word import, off the boot critical path.

Why this exists
---------------
The wake-critical Phase-A warm-up (``SpeechPipeline._warmup_phase_a``) gates
``VoiceBootStatus(ready=True)`` — the moment the desktop UI flips its
"VOICE STARTING…" spinner to "listening" — on the OpenWakeWord model coming up.
Profiling on a real desktop showed the dominant cost is the
``openwakeword.model`` *import* (it pulls in the onnxruntime C-extension), at
~2.9 s, NOT the model parse (~0.1 s).

Worse, since the serve-first fast-boot bootstrap (the server now answers in
~200 ms and every subsystem — brain build, wiki FTS index, conductor, workflows,
awareness — boots concurrently as ``create_task``), that import no longer runs
alone: it serializes on the global Python import lock against all those other
heavy imports and starves to 7-24 s (measured ``wake-start=14187``). That is the
"VOICE STARTING… forever" the user sees.

Firing the import once, early, in a daemon thread — before the server/brain
build grabs the import lock — moves the cost off the wake path. By the time
Phase A calls ``_ensure_model``, ``openwakeword.model`` is already in
``sys.modules``, so the load collapses to a no-op import + the ~0.1 s parse, and
Phase A falls back to its audio-stabilize floor.

This is monotonically safe: if the prefetch has not finished when Phase A needs
the model, Phase A simply waits on the same import it would have triggered
itself — never slower than today, only faster. A missing openWakeWord (headless
VPS base install with no ``[desktop]`` extra) is a logged no-op, never an error,
so the cloud-first boot is unaffected.
