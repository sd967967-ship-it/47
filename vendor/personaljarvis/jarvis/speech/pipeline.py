"""Speech pipeline with call/hangup state and parallel wake detection.

Wake detection runs in IDLE through two paths sharing one microphone fanout:

1. openWakeWord -- fast (15-30 ms), but less robust across pronunciations.
2. Whisper wake -- robust (800-1200 ms) and natively multilingual.

Activation feedback is visual while capture is live, avoiding both an input
dead zone and speaker echo in the recorded utterance. Global call/hangup
hotkeys remain active alongside wake detection.

    Three settings, all of them the user's call:

    * ``auto`` (the default) asks the key-aware resolver for one provider per
      OTHER credential family. Crossing inside a family buys nothing: one dead
      key takes every id that reads it down together (AP-22). It crosses only
      while the configured recognizer is itself a cloud one — see below.
    * a concrete provider id pins the crossover to that provider, even when it
      shares a family with the configured one — the user asked for it by name,
      and refusing a direct instruction because we think it is a poor one is
      how a setting stops being a setting. It is dropped only when it IS the
      configured provider, which would just be the same failure twice.
    * an empty value disables crossing entirely and keeps the honest
      single-provider failure, for anyone who would rather see an error than
      have their audio sent somewhere they did not expect.

    On top of those, one privacy floor that only the ``auto`` branch is subject
    to: when the configured recognizer transcribes on THIS machine, the
    automatic crossover is declined, because every id the key-aware resolver
    can offer is a cloud family (it excludes the local engine by contract) and
    an automatic upload of the raw audio is the one thing an on-device
    recognizer was chosen to prevent. A pinned provider id is untouched by
    this: that is an explicit instruction, and honouring it is the difference
    between a safe default and a policy — the same line the dictation polish
    pass draws for the transcript.

    """Which language a finished dictation is treated as. Never raises.

    Module-level and public because TWO paths finish a dictation — the live
    delivery in ``_finish_dictation`` and the Restore route's re-transcription —
    and a second copy of this decision is how the same recording would end up
    cleaned under two different rule sets depending on which button produced it.

    Three signals, and the ORDER between them is the whole fix:

    1. **The user's pin wins, always.** It is the one signal a person can set,
       so overruling it would leave them no way to be right.
    2. **Otherwise the TEXT outranks a provider tag that CONTRADICTS it.** The
       cloud Whisper APIs report a language on every request and report it
       confidently when it is wrong: the live 2026-07-28 history has German
       dictations tagged "English". The old gate only consulted the text when
       the tag was UNPARSEABLE, and ``normalize_language_tag`` turns "English"
       into "en", never "unknown" — so a confidently wrong tag always won. What
       that costs is not cosmetic: the English filler list used to contain "er",
       a top-frequency German pronoun, so a German sentence tagged English came
       back with its pronouns deleted and the cleanup reported a clean success.
    3. **A tag we cannot place stays exactly as it is.** ``detect_text_language``
       only knows de/en/es, so letting it overrule a "French" or "ja" tag would
       relabel that dictation as whichever of the three it scored highest on and
       then run THAT language's filler rules over it. Keeping the tag makes the
       cleanup a documented no-op (``reason="no_rules"``), which is the honest
       answer for ~95 of the 100 recognition languages this feature supports.

    **The answer is a CODE whenever one exists.** A tag we can place comes back
    as ``de`` / ``en`` / ``es``, never as the provider's own spelling of it.
    This is not cosmetic. The cloud Whisper APIs answer with the language NAME
    ("German"), every consumer downstream keys off this string, and the polish
    pass's rare-token guard — the one that stops a formatter from replacing
    words the user actually said — looks its vocabulary up by two-letter code
    and silently disables itself on anything else. Returning the raw tag
    therefore armed that guard only when the provider had been WRONG (the
    detector then supplied a real code) and disarmed it on every dictation the
    provider got RIGHT, which is the overwhelming majority. Live evidence:
    "kannst du es bitte mein download video abspeichern" was delivered as
    "Kannst du es bitte herunterladen?" — three content words replaced, no
    guard fired.  # i18n-allow: verbatim German transcript under test
    A tag with no code stays verbatim, so the honest no-op in point 3 is
    unchanged.

    A provider that reports nothing at all is the one case where the text is the
    only signal there is: ``[dictation].language = auto`` (the shipped default)
    plus a silent provider used to leave the cleanup with "no rules for this
    language", so every hesitation sound the user made shipped straight into the
    text while the setting said the cleanup was on.

    already set — and the only code that accepted an audio reading ran under
    ``if not session_language``. A session that started on the wrong language
    therefore could not be told, by anything, that it was wrong.

    What made it self-sustaining rather than merely wrong is the loop it closed.
    A recogniser handed ``language="en"`` does not mislabel German audio, it

    Distinct from :func:`resolve_dictation_language`, which labels a finished
    dictation. This one runs BEFORE a transcription and decides what the
    recogniser is told, which is a different question with a different failure:

    ``auto`` reaches a provider as "no language field", i.e. "detect it
    yourself". Whisper detects from the audio it is given, and a dictation is
    uploaded in ~4 s segments — far too little for a confident reading. On a
    short segment the model does not merely mislabel the language, it
    TRANSLATES: the same German recording came back verbatim when posted whole
    and as fluent English when posted in segments, and re-running one segment
    flipped between the two (measured against openai/whisper-large-v3 through
    OpenRouter, 2026-07-29). Nothing downstream can undo that — a translated
    sentence IS English to every text-based detector — so the repair has to
    happen before the call.

    The fix is to stop asking twice. Once a session has an AUDIO-derived
    reading of what is being spoken, every later piece is told that language
    explicitly instead of gambling on four seconds of context. Auto-detect is
    preserved where it belongs: the session still starts on ``auto``, and the
    reading is renewed from the audio as the session runs, so switching
    language mid-dictation still lands (the bilingual mandate — a static pin
    was the 2026-06-14 bug and is not what this restores).

# this is missing speech, not hearing a slow speaker. gpt-4o-class recognizers

# mid-recording pause is transcribed up to the pause and everything after it is
# silently dropped (live 2026-07-31 — an 11.6 s recording with a breath after
# the first sentence came back as that sentence alone, twice in a row). The
# verdict is judged on ENERGY versus token count, never on what the text says
# (AP-27's lesson); the repair re-reads the window split at its pauses and the
# longer reading wins.
#
# Raised from 1.0 after measuring what it actually caught: across 797 live

# floor, and a false positive only ever costs one extra read whose result is
# discarded unless it carries MORE speech. In words per minute of ACTUAL speech
# — every pause already excluded — the floor now sits at 78 wpm, against the

# into the next sentence. Dispatching at that moment answers half a request
# and lets the instant ack talk over the user's second half; the recombine
# window then cancels and re-dispatches the joined text — a wasted brain call
# and an audible stumble. So a complete utterance whose final lands while the
# VAD reports speech again is HELD (``ContinuationBuffer.hold``) and joined
# with the next utterance instead: one dispatch, no interruption. Bounded by
# the drain timer, which defers only while the user holds the floor.

        The maintainer's contract: a dictation turn owns the microphone, so the
        words being dictated must never trip the wake word (and two native input
        streams must never race for the same device — BUG-014 / AP-24).

        This is a STATE gate, not the content gate AP-27 forbids: it asks
        whether an application task is alive, with zero reference to audio or to
        any transcript, exactly like the three gates it sits beside
        (``_wake_lock_until``, mute, ``_state != IDLE``). It changes WHEN wake is
        listened to, never HOW a candidate is judged.

        Two independent things must BOTH hold for wake to stay blocked:

        1. A dictation task is alive — either the recording itself
           (``_dictation_task``) or the handover that is ending a voice
           conversation to get the microphone for one
           (``_dictation_handover_task``). Derived from ``task.done()``, never a
           bare bool somebody has to remember to clear — a crashed, cancelled or
           returned task is ``done()``, so the block lifts by itself.
        2. The watchdog deadline has not passed. ``_dictation_wake_block_until``
           is a timestamp set at start, mirroring ``_wake_lock_until``. A task
           that somehow hangs forever therefore still cannot deafen the wake
           word beyond it.

        The handover half matters as much as the recording half: ending the
        conversation returns the pipeline to IDLE with the wake loop free to
        re-arm, and a wake word firing in that gap would take the microphone
        straight back from the user who just pressed the dictation key.

        All defaults fail OPEN (no task → False, missing deadline → 0.0 →
        False), because the failure this guards against is BUG-037: permanently
        deaf with no visible cause and only a restart to fix.

        """Dictation key DOWN — start recording into the focused text field.

        Idempotent by design: every backend reports a press exactly once per
        real chord-down (the Windows poller too — ``HotkeyChecker.run`` fires
        ``on_press`` only on the ``key_state != 1`` transition, whatever older
        comments in this file claimed), but a stray duplicate edge inside the
        grace window is still treated as the same hold. Only the first edge
        from "key up" starts anything.

        **The latch heals itself.** A key-up edge can be lost — the pynput and
        Quartz backends clear their own chord state without firing ``on_release``
        when the input permission is revoked mid-chord, and a focus change, a
        UAC prompt or an RDP reconnect can do the same. A latch that only a
        release could clear then swallowed EVERY later press, which presents as
        "the dictation shortcut just stopped working" with no error and no way
        back except an app restart. So a press that arrives long after the last
        one reported the key down is treated as what it physically is — a fresh
        press on a key nobody is holding — not as a repeat. A second press edge
        can only exist if the chord went up in between, so anything past the
        grace window is either a lost key-up or a genuinely new press, and both
        want the same repair.

        **A press while a dictation nobody is holding is running is its STOP**
        (BUG-191). The latch says "up", yet the lane is busy: a hands-free key,
        the bar, a REST call started it — or a release edge never made it here
        and the recording is still open. Before this, that press went to
        ``start_dictation``, was refused as ``already_running`` (a refusal the
        bar deliberately paints as nothing), and the latch was dropped again:
        the key did nothing, visibly, forever, and only a restart ended the
        recording. The dictation key is the kill switch of its own lane — an
        explicit press ends whatever is running and delivers it, which is what
        the user pressing it means.

        ``toggle_key``, ``ws``, ``rest`` or the default ``api`` — purely so the
        start line in the log says so and the hold-key watchdog knows whether a
        release edge is owed (BUG-191: a recording that never ended could not
        be traced to its trigger, because the log never said which one it was).

        ``target`` decides where the finished transcript goes:

        * ``"chat"`` — publish the transcript only. This is the chat composer's
          mic button: the text lands in the app's own input box.
        * ``"insert"`` — additionally paste it into the focused text field of
          whatever application is in front. This is dictation mode proper.

        Returns ``False`` when it cannot start — no microphone, no STT, or a
        dictation already running. A live voice conversation is NOT one of
        those cases any more: see the handover below.

        **The dictation key wins.** Pressing it is a deliberate, explicit user
        action; a conversation left open in the background is not. On this
        machine's configuration a session never ends by itself (idle auto-hangup
        is off by maintainer mandate and the hangup key is unbound), so a single
        wake word at any point in the day used to make EVERY later dictation
        press refuse — silently — until the app was restarted. So a press now
        hangs the conversation up through the ordinary hangup chokepoint (the
        same one the bar's close-X uses), waits for the microphone to actually
        come back, and then records. This is the maintainer's own kill-switch
        doctrine: an explicit stop gesture beats whatever Jarvis is in the
        middle of, INCLUDING a half-spoken answer, and the answer is cut off the
        clean way — the player stops, the session unwinds through its normal
        teardown, and a bounded wait means a wedged teardown refuses honestly
        instead of hanging or deafening the key forever.

        **Every refusal is announced**, not just logged: each one publishes a
        ``DictationRefused`` carrying a stable reason token and a finished
        English sentence. Before that, a refused shortcut produced a
        ``log.info`` in a file the desktop app cannot display (CLAUDE.md §9), so
        the key simply did nothing and the user had no way to learn why. The
        boolean return is unchanged, so every existing caller (hotkey edge, WS
        handler, REST route) keeps working; ``True`` from the handover path
        means "accepted", and its failure arrives as ``DictationRefused``.

        This NEVER routes to the brain: it spawns ``_dictation_session`` which
        only publishes ``DictationStarted`` / ``DictationTranscript`` /
        ``DictationTranscribing`` / ``DictationCompleted`` events.

        Two things are wrong with reusing ``self._utterance_stt`` here, and both

        **The bias prompt.** ``[stt].bias_prompt`` is decoder priming for the
        VOICE path: a paragraph of vocabulary that steers Whisper towards the
        words a conversation with this assistant tends to contain. The repo
        already documents it as a silence-hallucination amplifier and
        deliberately withholds it from the local engine for exactly that reason
        — and then handed it to the dictation lane anyway, which is the one lane
        whose input is long, whose pauses are frequent, and whose output goes
        straight into somebody's document. It also biases decoding towards the
        prompt's own language, which is the second half of the wrong-language
        problem the delivery gates deal with. Dictation therefore builds its own
        instance with the voice prompt REMOVED, honouring
        ``[dictation].bias_prompt`` instead — absent by default, which is the
        point: a dictation is not a conversation and has no vocabulary to guess.
        The user's STT dictionary is NOT dropped: ``build_stt_from_config``
        merges those words separately, and they are the one bias a person asked
        for by name.

        **The fallback chain (AP-22).** The lane binds one provider for the
        whole session, so a depleted key ended the dictation even with three
        other keyed families sitting unused. ``_resolve_stt_fallback_chain``
        answers with one provider per CREDENTIAL family — never two ids reading
        the same keyring slot, because a 429 on a key is not survived by a
        sibling that draws on the same key — and ``FallbackSTT`` builds each of
        them lazily, on the first call that actually needs it (AP-26). It is
        the same resolver the voice lane's crossover uses, so ``[stt].fallback``
        means one thing in both lanes.

        Degrades to the voice instance on any failure: a dictation with the
        wrong prompt is enormously better than a dictation with no provider.

            """One transcription. ``(text, language, ok, error)``; never raises.

            ``ask_for`` overrides which language the provider is told. Left
            ``None`` it is derived from the pin and the session's own reading,
            which is right for a short segment; the FINAL pass passes ``auto``
            deliberately, because its windows are long enough to detect from
            and a language handed to a recognizer is a language it will
            translate INTO.

            Records the failure in ``stt_error`` instead of swallowing it. A
            later successful call clears it again — a single flaky segment in an
            otherwise working dictation is not a failed dictation. The same
            failure is ALSO appended to ``stt_failures``, which is never
            cleared: the clearing is what makes the slot honest about "the last
            thing that happened" and blind to "something went wrong earlier".

            ``ok`` is the part the caller cannot do without: an empty ``text``
            has TWO causes that need opposite handling — silence (the segment is
            genuinely done) and a failed call (the audio has not been read yet).
            Without this flag the segment loop treated both as "done" and
            advanced past audio nobody had transcribed, so one network hiccup
            deleted eight seconds of speech from the middle of the result with
            nothing anywhere saying so. That is the reported "I said more than
            this" bug in its entirety.

            ``error`` is the EXCEPTION OBJECT, and it is the reason this returns
            four values instead of three. The reason code stored in
            ``stt_error`` is a user-facing word; the retry ladder needs the HTTP
            status behind it to tell a rate limit (wait and try again) from a
            dead key (stop). Collapsing every failure into ``("", "", False)``
            destroyed exactly that, which is why the ladder used to retry a 401
            three times and re-fire into a 429 window 0.6 s after being told to
            wait.

            Every call is bounded. ``wait_for`` cancels our await, not a native
            thread — so this is a ceiling on how long the LANE waits, never a
            guarantee that the provider stopped working. That is still the whole
            difference between a dictation that ends with an honest error and
            one that never ends at all.

            ``probe`` marks a call made by the live probe task. Only those
            raise ``inference_active``, because that flag answers one question
            — "is the PROBE mid-call?" — for ``_stop_ptt_live_transcription``;
            a prefetched final window in flight must not make the release wait
            for a probe that is idle.

            ``sink``, when given, receives what the tuple has no room for and
            only the final pass needs: ``transcript_end_s`` — where the
            provider's transcript ends on its own clock (``None`` without
            segment timestamps), which is how a dropped tail is told apart
            from a slow speaker.

            the open tail bounded. One-per-tick can only keep up while every

            tail grows, and since the live preview re-uploads that whole tail on

            what turned a rate limit into a dictation with most of its words

            Two detectors, tried in this order:

            * **The transcript's own clock.** When the provider sent segment
              timestamps, a transcript that ends
              ``_DICTATION_TAIL_DROP_MIN_S`` or more before the window's speech
              does (``speech_runs``, energy) has lost its tail. Only that tail
              is re-read, from half a second before the transcript's end, in
              the language the long window detected; the head the provider got
              right is kept verbatim and the two are merged at the seam. This
              is the precise detector — a dropped last sentence is a fifth of
              the text and sits far above the token floor below — and it is
              the one the polish pass can trust, because the re-read is short
              and pause-free.
            * **Tokens against voiced seconds**, as before, for providers
              without timestamps and for a window that came back short without
              a clock to say where it stopped.

            A recognizer handed audio with a sustained mid-recording pause can
            stop at the pause and silently drop everything after it — the
            transcript arrives fluent, punctuated, and half the length of what
            was said. Detected here on energy alone: when the transcript's
            token count is far below what its VOICED seconds must have
            contained (``_DICTATION_TRUNCATION_TOKENS_PER_VOICED_S``), the
            piece is re-read in parts and the merged result replaces the
            original only when it actually carries more speech.

            Where to cut is decided by the audio, in that order of preference:

            * **At its pauses**, when the energy scan found more than one
              speech run. Those seams cost nothing — no word sits on them.
            * **In half at its quietest middle moment**, when it found only
              one. That case used to return early and stand: continuous speech
              that came back half-transcribed had no pause to split on, so the
              guard looked at the most ordinary truncation there is and did
              nothing. A recognizer that stops short on a long read rarely
              stops at the same place on a short one.

            The parts are told the language the long window just detected
            rather than asked to detect it themselves — a short clip guessing
            its language is the translation trap the long windows exist to
            avoid. A part that cannot be read keeps the original transcript: a
            dropped middle is worse than the dropped tail it would repair.

            request from the one the live line makes. Two properties, both of
            them the point:

            * **Long windows.** A recognizer detects the spoken language from
              the audio it is given. Eight seconds is not enough to be sure,
              and an unsure model does not merely mislabel — it TRANSLATES.
              That is why one continuous German recording used to arrive with
              one paragraph verbatim and the next in fluent English.
            * **Auto-detect per window, not a carried-over pin.** With
              ``[dictation].code_switching`` on (the default) nothing tells the
              recognizer which language to expect, so a speaker who switches
              language mid-sentence is transcribed as they spoke rather than
              translated into whichever language the session had decided on.
              A user who turns it off gets their pin handed over outright.

            Overlapping windows mean a word on a boundary is spoken in full
            inside at least one of them; the duplicate that creates is removed
            from the text (``jarvis.dictation.merge``), which is possible,
            while recovering half a word is not.

            Most windows were already read while the user was speaking
            (``_prefetch_final_windows``). What is left here is the open tail —
            and, should the probe have been slow or absent, any window it did
            not get to — started together and awaited together, so the wait
            after release is one window's read, not the recording's length.

            Returns ``""`` when nothing could be read — the caller then falls
            back to the incremental text rather than losing the dictation.

        dictated words. A backstop at the store beats a rule every future caller
        has to remember.

        ``lost_audio_s`` is how many seconds of the recording were attempted
        and never read — see the ``partial`` entry in
        ``jarvis.dictation.outcomes``. It is a SEPARATE argument from
        ``stt_error`` on purpose, and the distinction is the whole of the fix:
        an error says something went wrong, this says something was lost, and
        only the second one is a reason to stop calling the dictation a success
        and to keep its audio. Defaults to zero so every existing caller (and
        the crash path below) keeps today's behaviour exactly.

        ``dropped_audio_s`` is the OTHER way to end up missing words, and it is
        kept apart from ``lost_audio_s`` because the two owe the user different
        sentences. Lost audio was recorded and never read — a retry could still
        read it, which is what Restore offers. Dropped audio was never recorded:
        the capture queue overflowed while the loop was busy and those frames
        are gone, so promising Restore would point at a button that cannot help.
        Both degrade the outcome to ``partial``; only the first one promises
        anything.

        ``audio`` is the session's raw PCM; it is written to a local sidecar
        only when the dictation left the user missing words AND they allow it
        (``[dictation].keep_failed_audio``), which is what a later Restore
        transcribes again.

        Returns the text to dispatch to the brain, or ``None`` if the fragment
        was buffered (caller stays silent and returns to LISTENING /
        WAITING_FOR_COMPLETION).

        Behaviour:
        * Fresh turn, classifier sees no clear dangling marker → return ``text``
          unchanged (precision: complete or unsure → answer).
        * Fresh turn, classifier returns a verdict → buffer the fragment, arm
          the per-gap timeout, return ``None``. The pipeline stays silent and
          the mic stays open (user-mandated "still re-listen").
        * Buffer pending, continuation arrives → concatenate; if the joined
          text is now complete OR ``chain_count >= completion_max_chain`` →
          flush to brain (return joined text); else keep waiting.
        * Buffer pending, cancel phrase ("vergiss das" / "never mind") →
          discard and return ``None``.
        * Per-gap timeout (``completion_wait_ms``) fires elsewhere → speak a
          short follow-up cue and clear the buffer (AD-OE6 / zero silent drops).

        NOTE: The parallel-session helpers ``_schedule_pending_flush`` /
        ``_pending_flush_after_delay`` / ``_emit_completeness_signal`` from the
        sibling utterance-completeness design are still present in this file

        conflicts with this method's FLUSH/SPEAK-FALLBACK directive. Reconciling
        the two design schools is a follow-up cleanup task for the user.

        clarifying question instead of discarding silently (AD-OE6

        Cancelled the moment the next utterance arrives, so a thinking-pause-

          fragment) — low latency, non-verbal, non-interruptive.
        - ``spoken``:  very short phrase via ``self._speak(...)`` (through
          ``scrub_for_voice``). Used mid-conversation when the assistant has already
          spoken at least once — a spoken cue feels natural in a running dialogue.

        ``signal_mode`` in ``[speech.completeness]`` overrides the auto selection:
        ``"earcon"`` always earcon, ``"spoken"`` always spoken.

        Failure in this helper must NEVER crash the turn (AD-OE6): the whole
        method is wrapped in try/except so any signal bug stays silent.

        (~600 ms) and truncated the answer — speaker→mic echo (user feedback
        2026-04-22). The conservative policy (1.5 s grace, Silero 0.97, 12
        consecutive frames ≈ 380 ms) fixed headphone leakage but NOT open
        laptop speakers next to a built-in mic: there the assistant's own
        voice is loud, sustained, and perfectly speech-shaped, so Silero —
        which cannot tell whose voice it hears — confirmed a "barge" against
        the assistant itself. That false confirm truncated the audible answer

          grace-window frames — which during playback ARE our own echo.

        Every ``feed`` runs in a worker thread: the per-frame ONNX inference
        used to run synchronously on the voice event loop and starved the
        ~120 ms playback write batches on slow CPUs (BUG-062 cause #2 —
