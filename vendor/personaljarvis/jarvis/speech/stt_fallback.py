"""Runtime STT fallback — cross to another provider family when one fails.

``build_stt_from_config`` already picks a different provider when the configured
one has no usable credential. That is a BUILD-time decision, and it was the only
one there was: once a provider was chosen, a failure at CALL time ended the
transcription. So a Groq rate limit in the middle of a dictation deleted the
user's words even though three other keyed providers were sitting there unused
(live bug 2026-07-29: a 137 s dictation returned 367 characters, the log full of
``429 Too Many Requests``).

That is exactly what AP-22 forbids — "a missing / depleted / 429 / 402 /
unreachable one degrades or crosses to a **different family** with an honest
message, never bricking a core path". This module supplies the missing half.

What it does NOT do, on purpose:

* **It never retries a rejection the audio itself caused.** A 400 means this
  provider understood the request and refused it; sending the same bytes to
  another provider would just burn a second quota for the same answer. Only
  failures another provider could plausibly survive cross over — the quota,
  availability and transport ones enumerated in :func:`_is_crossable`.
* **It never builds an alternate on the boot path** (AP-26). The chain is a
  list of provider NAMES; an instance is constructed the first time it is
  actually needed and then kept.
* **It never reorders the user's choice.** The configured provider is always
  tried first, except while it is in the cooldown a rate limit put it in —
  which is the whole point: hammering a 429 keeps it locked.
