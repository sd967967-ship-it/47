"""Meter what speech spends — without ever standing in the way of speech.

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech do not bill by token, so nothing on the
model-cost path sees them: STT is billed per minute of audio, TTS per
character of input. Neither number is recorded anywhere in the app today,
which is why the Spend section's speech row is permanently empty.

Instrumenting call sites would not fix that. ``synthesize`` alone is called
from ten places in :mod:`jarvis.speech.pipeline` and more outside it, and the
eleventh call site — the one somebody adds next month — would silently miss.
So the *provider* is wrapped instead: one decorator per protocol, applied once
where the provider is built, and every call site is covered, including the
ones that do not exist yet.

Three properties are non-negotiable, in this order:

**It never delays speech.** Measuring is arithmetic on values already in hand:
``len(text)``, and the length of the PCM a chunk already carries. The sink is
called synchronously and nothing here awaits it (AP-9). The wrappers are
straight pass-throughs — a chunk is yielded onward the moment it arrives, and
no audio is ever buffered.

**It never breaks speech.** A sink that raises, a provider attribute that is
missing, a clock that misbehaves — all of it is caught and logged, and the
utterance continues. A metering bug that silenced Jarvis would be a far worse
bug than the missing ledger it was written to fix.

**It reports what was actually spent, not what completed.** A cancelled turn
that sent 400 characters to ElevenLabs spent those 400 characters, and a
transcription abandoned mid-stream still consumed the audio the provider read.
Every measured call reports from a ``finally``, so an abandoned generator, a
cancellation and an exception all still reach the ledger.

Wrapping is free when nothing is listening: ``meter_tts(provider, None)``
returns the very same object, so an install with no cost sink pays nothing —
not an attribute lookup, not a stack frame.

Pricing lives next door in :mod:`jarvis.costs.speech_rates`; this module only
counts. Nothing here initialises at import time (AP-26).
