"""Several subscriptions per coding CLI, switchable without logging out.

A user can hold more than one seat for the same CLI — two Claude Max plans, two
ChatGPT/Codex plans. Out of the box only one of them is reachable: the CLI keeps
exactly one login, so getting to the other means a full ``logout`` / ``login``
round trip that throws the first one away. Holding two plans and being able to
use only one at a time is the problem this module exists to remove.

**One account is one directory.** A CLI that qualifies resolves its whole
identity — credentials, account file, conversation history — from a single
directory, and publishes the environment variable that moves it. WHICH CLIs
those are, and which variables move them, is registry data
(``jarvis.workspace.agents.AccountSpec``) rather than a list here; ask
:func:`platforms`. A CLI with no such variable simply has no directory to
switch and is honestly absent from this feature instead of being offered a
switcher that would silently keep spending one login.

So switching is not an auth operation at all: it decides which directory the
NEXT spawn points at. Every login stays valid, side by side, indefinitely — and
because the choice is per spawn, two panes can run two different subscriptions
at the same moment, which is the actual reason to hold two.

**Tokens are never copied between accounts.** That is the obvious shortcut and
it is a trap: Claude Code refreshes its OAuth access token *in place*, so a copy
starts dying the moment it is made — the 2026-07-06 and 2026-07-10 incidents
behind :mod:`jarvis.claude_credentials` are exactly that failure, one directory
further left each time. Separate directories each refresh themselves and cannot
go stale relative to one another.

**A redirected directory moves the settings too, so the mode is carried over.**
The directory holds more than a login: the user-level configuration lives there
as well, including the mode the CLI starts a session in. Left alone, a pane on
an added account therefore opened in the CLI's built-in fallback — manual mode —
however the user had equipped it globally, and had to be switched over by hand
every time. :func:`inherit_default_mode` copies exactly those mode settings
across (nothing else, and never over a value set for that account by hand), so a
pane starts the way the same CLI starts in an ordinary terminal.

**The built-in account is synthetic.** Every platform always offers the CLI's
own default directory as an account that was never created here, cannot be
deleted, and is never written to the store. A user who never opens this feature
therefore has exactly the behaviour they had before, and an empty store is a
complete, valid state rather than a broken one.

Storage follows the pattern ``recents.py`` and ``resume_store.py`` already
proved in this codebase: one small JSON file under the per-user data directory
(never the repo, never ``jarvis.toml``, never a secret in it — only labels and
paths), atomic writes, and defensive reads where a truncated, hand-edited or
newer-version file degrades to "only the built-in account exists" instead of
breaking the view that reads it.

Cross-platform by construction: ``pathlib`` throughout, no hardcoded user paths,
and no OS-specific branch. The one honest caveat is macOS, where Claude Code
keeps credentials in the Keychain rather than in the config directory — see
:func:`describe`, which reports an account with no readable login as exactly
that instead of quietly routing panes to whichever login the CLI finds.

    whose settings file is its OWN (hand-edited, or written by the CLI inside a
    running pane) is never overwritten wholesale, and the mode keys are still
    worth carrying into it one at a time.

    **The gap this closes.** Pointing ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` / ``CODEX_HOME`` at
    an account's own directory moves the CLI's whole user-level configuration,
    not only its login — and the default operating mode lives there. So a pane on
    an added account started in the CLI's built-in fallback (Claude Code's manual
    mode, Codex's ask-every-time) even when the user had globally equipped
    something else, and every single pane had to be switched over by hand.
    Running the same CLI from an ordinary terminal never had that problem, which
    is exactly the inconsistency this removes.

    Only the mode settings are mirrored — never credentials, never history, never
    the rest of the file. Project-level settings are untouched by the redirect
    (the CLI reads those from the folder it runs in) and need nothing here.

    **A value the user typed into the account is never overwritten.** The mirror
    file records what was last copied across, so a setting that no longer matches
    it is a deliberate per-account choice and is left exactly as it is; one that
    still matches follows a later change of the global default. An account with
    no such setting at all simply receives the global one.

    Returns True when something was actually written. Never raises: a spawn must
    not fail because a settings file could not be read or updated — the pane then
    opens in the CLI's own fallback, which is the behaviour that existed before.
