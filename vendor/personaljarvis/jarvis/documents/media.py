"""What a photo, recording or video says about itself before any model sees it.

A picture that arrives with nothing but a filename is nearly useless to a
memory system: the file's modification time is the day it was *copied*, not the
day it was taken, so a holiday album restored from a backup collapses onto one
meaningless afternoon. The camera already wrote the truth into the file — this
module reads it back.

Two jobs, both deliberately small:

* **Self-description** (:func:`media_metadata`) — capture time, camera, GPS,
  dimensions, duration. Enough that the item is findable by time and place
  *immediately*, before the enrichment stage has described anything.
* **A way back to the bytes** (:class:`MediaRef`) — a photo is stored as an
  item the moment it is seen, but describing it happens later, in a different
  process, possibly days later. The reference is how that later stage opens the
  same file again.

**Standard library only, and it never raises.** EXIF is a TIFF directory
embedded in a JPEG segment; ``struct`` reads it in eighty lines. Refusing to
add an imaging library to the base install is not frugality for its own sake —
it is what keeps ingestion working on a `python:3.11-slim` VPS with no image
stack at all (charter §3).

The trade that buys: JPEG and HEIC/AVIF are read, and every other format
returns an empty dict rather than a wrong guess. A PNG's textual chunks and a
video's duration are deliberately not parsed here — the enrichment stage's
description and transcript are the content that matters for those, and half a
metadata parser would be a claim without a source.
