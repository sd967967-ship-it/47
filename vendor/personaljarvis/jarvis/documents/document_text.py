"""Read plain text out of the opaque document formats a real folder holds.

A folder a user actually chooses is not a notes vault: it holds PDFs, Word
files and slide decks next to the markdown. Those are containers, not text —
reading them as UTF-8 yields megabytes of replacement characters — so the
folder walk routes them here instead.

Two rules govern everything below:

* **A failure is a SKIP, never a raise.** One password-protected PDF or one
  truncated ``.docx`` must not end a walk over ten thousand files. Every
  extractor returns ``None`` and logs; the caller drops that one file.
* **No new dependency for the Office formats.** ``.docx`` and ``.pptx`` are
  zip archives of XML, which the standard library opens on every platform.
  Only PDF needs ``pypdf``, which is already a base requirement — and a
  install without it degrades to a logged skip rather than an import error
  (charter §3: the walk still has to work on a bare server).

Nothing here touches the event loop: every function BLOCKS on file I/O and is
called from the connector's worker thread.
