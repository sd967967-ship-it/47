"""Get the readable text out of one file, whatever format it is in.

The gap this closes (audit, 2026-07-26): every reader that met a binary gave
up. Google Drive produced no item at all for a PDF or a Word document, Dropbox
had an extension allowlist that excluded exactly the formats people keep their
thinking in, Gmail never downloaded an attachment, and the local-folder walk
read `.md` and `.txt` and nothing else. A contract, a slide deck, a scanned
invoice, a spreadsheet of decisions — all invisible to a system whose whole
purpose is remembering them.

One service, so a format is supported once rather than per reader.

**Almost all of it is standard library, on purpose.** Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
OpenDocument and EPUB files are ZIP archives containing XML; `zipfile` plus
`xml.etree` reads them without `python-docx`, `openpyxl`, `python-pptx`,
`odfpy` or `ebooklib`. That is not cleverness for its own sake — every avoided
dependency is one that cannot fail to build a wheel on the maintainer's Intel
Mac, cannot bloat a `python:3.11-slim` image, and cannot break a base install
(repo rule §3). PDF is the one exception: it needs `pypdf`, which is already a
dependency.

**Never raises, always answers.** A corrupt file, a missing optional
dependency, an encrypted PDF and a JPEG are four different outcomes and each
returns an :class:`ExtractResult` saying which. A reader stores the item
regardless and marks `content_missing`, so a later run — with the extra
installed, or after the file is repaired — can reclaim it instead of the item
silently never existing.

**Format is decided by content first, name second.** Magic bytes do not lie;
extensions do, constantly (`.txt` holding a PDF, a `.docx` that is really a
ZIP of something else, no extension at all on a Drive export).

Relationship to :mod:`jarvis.documents.document_text`: that module is the
path-based helper for the three formats a notes folder actually holds.
This one is the general service — ten formats, and it accepts BYTES,
which is what an email attachment, a Slack upload or a Drive export is before
it ever touches disk. They share the hardened XML parser rather than each
keeping a copy: office archives arrive from strangers, and a second copy of a
security primitive is a second thing to forget to update.
