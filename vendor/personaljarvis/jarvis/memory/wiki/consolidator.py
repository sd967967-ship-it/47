"""Stage-2 consolidator — the body-aware ADD/UPDATE/NOOP/INVALIDATE judge.

Drains pending candidate facts from the :class:`CandidateJournal` in
batches, retrieves the k-nearest existing pages per candidate (FTS5/BM25
via :class:`VaultSearch` + subject-slug overlap — no embeddings, no new
dependency), shows the judge their FULL BODIES (undoing the legacy
curator's ``del repo`` blindness), and applies its decisions through the
shared guarded write pipeline (``WikiCurator.apply_external_updates``:
link demotion → AtomicWriter backup/secret-guard/validate/rollback/FTS).

Decision semantics (vocab: ``constants.CURATOR_DECISIONS``):

- ``add``      → create a new page (entities/concepts/projects).
- ``update``   → merge the fact into an existing page IN PLACE; the
                 prompt requires every existing fact/section to survive.
- ``noop``     → the vault already knows this; journal row closed.
- ``invalidate`` → the fact contradicts an existing page: the superseded
                 page gets frontmatter ``valid_until`` + ``superseded-by``
                 (set mechanically here, never by the LLM) — invalidate,
                 never delete (Zep pattern).

Every candidate leaves the batch with an explicit journal status —
``consolidated`` / ``rejected`` / ``skipped`` — nothing is dropped
silently. Runs only inside the CuratorScheduler's lock+cooldown gates
as a background task (AP-9).
