"""``WikiCurator`` — the Phase B1 Wave-2 orchestrator.

Wires the four parallel-built B1 components into one ingest pipeline:

    new source content
        │
        ▼
    CuratorLLM.propose_updates    (Instance D — "what should change?")
        │
        ▼  list[PageUpdate]
    AtomicWriter.apply             (Instance C — "write it safely")
        │
        ▼  WriteResult
    LogWriter.append_log_entry     (Instance B — "record what happened")
        │
        ▼
    return WriteResult

The curator owns no domain logic of its own. It is a composer: every
substantive decision (which pages to touch, whether to skip a write,
how to roll back, how to render the log entry) lives in the dependency
it delegates to. That makes each piece independently swappable —
Instance C can be replaced with an alternative writer, Instance D with
an alternative LLM, without touching this file.

See ``docs/phase-b1-wiki-curator/README.md`` Part 6 for the wave-2 plan
and ``docs/adr/0013-knowledge-wiki-architecture.md`` for the long-term
context.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo:
        :class:`PageRepository` — parses + renders single pages. Passed
        through to the writer for post-write validation and to the
        curator-LLM so it can re-parse vault snapshots if needed.
    vault:
        :class:`VaultIndex` — whole-vault read view. Handed to the
        curator-LLM for the keyword-overlap top-slugs ranker.
    writer:
        :class:`AtomicWriter` — performs the backup + write + validate
        + rollback pipeline. Owns the vault's write surface entirely.
    llm:
        :class:`CuratorLLM` — proposes ``list[PageUpdate]`` from a
        source. Returns ``[]`` when the source is not salient.
    log_writer:
        :class:`LogWriter` — appends one ``log.md`` entry per
        successful ingest. Skipped when zero updates land.
    vault_root:
        Used for the log entry's ``[[entities/...]]``-style wikilinks
        and to synthesise a ``WriteResult`` when the LLM returns an
        empty proposal (the writer was never called, so no backup
        was taken).
    event_publisher:
        Optional application event publisher. After an app-owned write
        lands, the curator emits :class:`WikiPageChanged` so an open Wiki
        view can invalidate its tree and graph without depending on an OS
        filesystem watcher noticing the curator's atomic rename.
