"""File-based exclusive lock for WikiCurator runs.

Uses ``open(path, "x")`` semantics (``O_CREAT | O_EXCL``) for atomic
creation, which works on every OS without OS-specific primitives such as
``fcntl`` (Unix-only) or ``msvcrt.locking`` (Windows-only).

The lock file contains the writing process's PID and a WALL-CLOCK
(``time.time()``) timestamp so a stale lock — one left behind by a
crashed process — can be detected and stolen automatically by ANY later
process. The timestamp in the file must never be ``time.monotonic()``:
the monotonic clock restarts near zero on every boot and is only
comparable within one process, so a cross-process/cross-reboot staleness
check against it is meaningless (a pre-reboot lock could look "fresh" or
"from the future" forever). The in-process acquire deadline loop DOES
use monotonic — correct for a local timeout.
