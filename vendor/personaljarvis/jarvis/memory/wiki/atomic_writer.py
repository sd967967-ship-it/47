"""AtomicWriter — the only disk-write path for wiki entity/concept/project pages.

Phase B1, Instance C. Designed against ``docs/phase-b1-wiki-curator/README.md``
Part 5 → Instance C and the binding Protocol in
``jarvis/memory/wiki/protocols.py``.

The five-step pipeline (executed inside one ``apply()`` call, in order):

1. **Concurrent-edit lock** — for every update, check
   ``target_path.stat().st_mtime``. If it is within
   :data:`CONCURRENT_EDIT_LOCK_SECONDS` of ``time.time()``, the update
   is skipped and the path is recorded under
   ``WriteResult.skipped_due_to_recent_edit``. This is the "user is
   editing in Obsidian" guard.
2. **Backup** — exactly *one* tar.gz snapshot of the whole vault per
   ``apply()`` call, even when fifteen pages are about to change.
   Backup is skipped entirely when nothing survived step 1.
3. **Write** — for each surviving update, write to a sibling tempfile
   in the target's parent directory, then :func:`os.replace`. The
   tempfile-in-parent placement is what makes the replace atomic on
   Windows (same-drive requirement) — the writer asserts the same-drive
   invariant and raises a clear error if it ever fails.
4. **Validate** — re-parse every just-written page via
   :meth:`PageRepository.parse`. Pages that come back with
   ``is_schema_valid=False`` (or that raise inside ``parse``) are rolled
   back individually from the snapshot taken in step 2. The other
   pages stay applied — partial success is the default mode. Callers that
   pass ``all_or_nothing=True`` instead get call-scoped atomicity: any
   preflight refusal or post-write failure leaves every page unchanged.
5. **Return** — :class:`WriteResult` summarising what landed, what was
   skipped, what was rolled back, plus the absolute path of the
   snapshot for forensics.

The writer holds a single ``asyncio.Lock`` so that two concurrent
ingests on the same vault serialise their pipelines. This keeps the
backup/rotate cycle race-free without dragging in a process-level
sentinel file.
