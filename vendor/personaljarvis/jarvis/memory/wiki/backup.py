"""BackupManager — tar.gz snapshot + single-file restore for the wiki vault.

Phase B1, Instance C. Companion to :class:`AtomicWriter`.

The vault sits at ``<repo_root>/wiki/obsidian-vault/`` (gitignored — personal
data). Each :func:`AtomicWriter.apply` call takes exactly one snapshot
before touching disk. On a per-page validation failure, that snapshot
is the only source the writer trusts to restore the offending file.

Design notes
------------
* The tar archive is stored at ``<repo_root>/wiki-backups/wiki-<ts>.tar.gz``.
  The naming matches the existing migration backup pattern in
  ``scripts/wiki_migrate_v0_to_v1.py:make_backup`` so operators only have
  one mental model for "backup files of the wiki".
* Archive member names are **vault-relative** (``entities/ruben.md`` —
  *not* the absolute path on the operator's disk). This makes restore
  straightforward and prevents leaking the host filesystem layout.
* ``_archive/`` and ``attachments/`` are skipped — they can be large and
  are not part of the curated wiki surface.
* Rotation keeps the ``max_backups`` most recent archives and deletes
  the rest. Failures inside rotation are logged but never raised — a
  failed GC must not turn a successful ingest into a failure.
* The class holds no mutable state besides configuration. Reentrancy
  during a single ``apply()`` call is the caller's job (AtomicWriter
  serialises via its own lock).
