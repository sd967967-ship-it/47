"""In-memory index of the wiki vault.

The vault on disk holds four kinds of pages (entities, concepts, projects,
sessions). The ``VaultIndex`` walks those four directories on demand,
parses each markdown file through the ``PageRepository`` (Instance A) and
keeps two dictionaries:

* ``_by_slug``     — ``{slug -> WikiPage}`` for direct lookup.
* ``_backlinks``   — ``{slug -> [pages that contain a wikilink to slug]}``.

Cheap stale-detection: every page entry carries the ``st_mtime`` it was
parsed at. When a caller asks for a page (``find_by_slug``,
``pages_by_type``, ``backlinks_to``) the index re-stats the underlying
file. If the mtime has advanced beyond what is cached the page is
re-parsed on the fly. This keeps the index honest when the user edits
in Obsidian without forcing a full ``scan()``.

Write surface for this module: NONE on the page directories themselves.
``log.md`` is owned by ``LogWriter``, ``index.md`` by ``IndexBuilder``.
This class is read-only over the four page directories.
