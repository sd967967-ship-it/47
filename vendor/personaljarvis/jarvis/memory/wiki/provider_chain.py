"""Key-aware provider fallback for wiki-tier LLM calls (extractor + curator).

Why this exists
---------------
The main ``BrainManager`` survives a dead / throttled / keyless provider by
looping over a key-aware fallback CHAIN (``manager._build_fallback_chain``): it
tries the next provider on any failure and only gives up when none is reachable.
The wiki extractor (stage 1) and curator (stage 2) did NOT — each resolved to a
SINGLE provider (``cfg.provider`` or ``brain.primary``) and, on any error,
returned an empty list with only a WARNING.

Live forensic 2026-06-30: the user's openrouter key was over its total limit
(403), gemini was out of prepaid credit (429) AND claude-api auth was rejected
(401) at various moments. Whenever the wiki's single resolved provider was the
one erroring, the whole pipeline silently no-op'd — nothing journaled, nothing
written — even though the main voice brain limped along via its own fallback
chain and a working provider existed. The wiki looked dead while the user had
credit. This module gives the wiki the SAME resilience, plus an HONEST signal
when the whole chain is exhausted (AP-22 single-provider brick / AP-23
maintainer-config coupling).

    response with a short reason; the next provider is then tried before the
    caller gives up on malformed or truncated structured output.

    ``allow_last_rejection`` marks CONTENT-verdict rejections ("nothing
    usable in this turn") that may end the chain: two agreeing providers are
    consensus and stop immediately. ``allow_lone_rejection`` (default: same

    opinion available — is accepted as final; a reason outside it stays a
    retryable failure, so one weak provider can never be terminal proof that
    a transcript held no facts.

    ``content_verdict`` classifies a ``validate`` rejection as a deterministic
    CURATION verdict on WELL-FORMED output (e.g. "companion page missing",
    "update removes existing content") as opposed to a broken RESPONSE
    (truncated / unparseable JSON) or a transport failure. A provider hitting a
    content verdict is HEALTHY — it answered; only the judged decision violated
    a curation rule. Such a rejection therefore (1) does NOT cool the provider
    down and (2) does NOT paint the red 'Chain failure' banner: a banner is a
    PROVIDER-health signal, and one un-consolidatable candidate is not provider
    damage. The caller's own bounded retry/park handles the candidate quietly.
    Live 2026-07-23: a single mis-kinded 'cloudflare-plugin' activity candidate
    demanded a companion page no provider produced, wedging the chain and
    listing all 8 providers as broken on every journal trigger.

    ``record_health=False`` isolates an optional side lane from the normal Wiki
    health strip. Media enrichment uses the same provider machinery,
    but an unreadable picture neither means normal Markdown capture is broken
    nor has authority to clear a real capture failure after a later success.
    ``failure_scope`` likewise isolates the short provider cooldown: an image-
    specific 400 must not demote that same provider for ordinary text curation.
