"""Deterministic graph-connectivity post-processing for session rollups.

The ``SessionRollupWorker`` (Phase B7) used to drop the raw LLM paragraph
verbatim into the session page. The LLM, told only to "reference concrete
tools using ``[[wikilink]]`` syntax" and fed the focused-window name of each
episode, wrapped ephemeral apps in Title-Case display links
(``[[Brave Browser]]``, ``[[PowerShell]]``, ``[[Snipping Tool]]``). None of
those resolve to a real ``entities/<slug>.md`` page, so Obsidian rendered each
as an orphan placeholder node — and because nothing linked a session to a
durable hub, every session became an isolated 2-node "dust pair" in the graph.

These pure helpers turn that paragraph into graph-connected markdown, with the
same discipline as ``scrub_for_voice``: **regex only, no LLM call, no disk
write.** The worker supplies a :class:`SlugIndex` built from the live vault.

The pipeline the worker runs is:

1. :func:`strip_dangling_wikilinks` — remove a token-truncated ``[[…`` fragment
   that has no closing ``]]`` (e.g. ``[[PickerHost.`` at end of a capped
   response).
2. :func:`rewrite_body_links` — for every closed ``[[target]]``: if it resolves
   to an existing page, rewrite to the canonical ``[[dir/slug|Display]]`` form;
   otherwise demote it to plain text. This implements the schema rule
   *"A broken wikilink is a bug … refuse the link and use plain text."*
3. :func:`build_related_footer` — append a deterministic ``## Related`` block
   linking the durable hubs every session shares (the user entity, the most
   relevant project, plus any entity/concept the body genuinely referenced) so
   each session joins the network instead of floating alone.
