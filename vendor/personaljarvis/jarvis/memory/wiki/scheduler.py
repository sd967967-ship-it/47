"""Scheduler that gates ``WikiCurator`` runs with a cooldown and a file lock.

Architecture
------------
``CuratorScheduler`` is the traffic-light between the rest of the system
and ``WikiCurator.ingest``.  It enforces two independent guards:

1. **VaultLock** — prevents two concurrent curator runs on the same
   vault regardless of how they were triggered.  The lock is always
   respected; even MANUAL triggers must wait for it.

2. **Cooldown** — prevents the curator from being hammered by repeated
   SESSION_END events in a tight loop.  MANUAL triggers bypass this
   guard; PERIODIC and SESSION_END honour it.

Periodic runs are opt-in: when ``config.enable_periodic`` is ``False``
(the default) the periodic task must not be constructed at all — a
clean design instead of a flag that fires and is silently rejected.

Example
-------
::

    scheduler = CuratorScheduler(
        curator=curator,
        lock=VaultLock(Path("data/wiki_curator.lock")),
        config=scheduler_config,
    )

    result = await scheduler.trigger(TriggerSource.SESSION_END,
                                     episode_paths=[p1, p2])
    if not result.triggered:
        print("skipped:", result.skip_reason)
