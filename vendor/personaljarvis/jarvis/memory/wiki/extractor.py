"""Stage-1 conversation fact extractor (Wave 2, ADD-only).

One cheap LLM call per eligible conversation turn extracts 0..N atomic
candidate facts and appends them to the :class:`CandidateJournal`. This
stage NEVER touches the vault — a failing or over-eager extractor cannot
corrupt existing pages; the expensive judgment (ADD/UPDATE/NOOP/INVALIDATE
against real page bodies) happens later in the batched Stage-2 consolidator.

Provider/model resolve through the SAME hook as the curator
(``curator_llm._resolve_provider_and_model`` over ``[memory.wiki.curator]``),
so the Wiki settings card drives both stages — cheap router-tier model by
default, explicit override wins.

Stage-1 selection contract (spec §4.2, D1 "completeness with cleanliness"):
recall-biased — when unsure whether something matters long-term, surface a
candidate; smalltalk and contentless turns yield ``[]``. The journal +
Stage-2 NOOP de-duplication contain the over-capture.

AP-9: callers invoke :meth:`extract_and_journal` only from fire-and-forget
background tasks; this module never runs on the voice critical path.

Rules:
- A fact must still be useful weeks later: identity, preferences, recurring
  activities and habits, people, relationships, owned assets or vehicles,
  places, organizations, projects, decisions, plans, and biographical events.
  Rephrase it so it stands alone.
- Explicit ownership or naming is durable even when phrased briefly, for
  example "I own the yacht" or "My yacht is named Aurora".
- "basis" grades the evidence. "explicit": the user directly asserted the
  fact ("I own a yacht.", "Golf is my favourite sport."). "behavioral": the
  user described first-person lived experience — doing, practicing, or
  enjoying something — without naming it as a preference or habit. "I love
  being out on golf courses with my buddies, playing this sport actively"
  grounds {"fact": "The user plays golf actively with friends and enjoys
  it", "kind": "activity", "basis": "behavioral"}. Habitual markers ("every
  Saturday", "again", "as usual") in a first-person report count as
  behavioral grounding. Never label a lived-experience inference "explicit".
- "salience" scores how central the fact is to the USER's own life:
  5 = core identity, close people, health. 4 = possessions, recurring habits
  and activities, active projects. 3 = peripheral personal facts. 2 = world
  knowledge loosely tied to the user. 1 = trivia. Score user-centrality,
  never interestingness.
- A topic mention, one-off question, or request for information grounds
  NOTHING — no basis rescues it. "What are the benefits of Vitamin D?"
  yields []; do not infer a supplement interest or plan.
  "Tell me about Monaco." yields []; do not infer interest in Monaco,
  travel plans, attendance, residence, or preference. Never manufacture a
  personal connection from curiosity.
- If a question also contains a self-disclosure, extract only the disclosed
  fact and never invent a reason for the question.
- Quality bar: you feed a curated map of the user's life, not a transcript
  archive. For facts the user explicitly asserted about themselves, their
  people, possessions, health, habits, and projects, forgetting is the worse
  failure. For everything else, writing junk is the worse failure — when in
  doubt about a fact with no strong personal anchor, return [].
- Return [] for smalltalk, pure questions, commands without durable content,
  fleeting bodily/status chatter, or turns that only concern the immediate
  task. "I need the bathroom" is not durable memory.
- Extract facts asserted or confirmed by the USER in the focus turn only.
  Never turn an assistant statement, guess, suggestion, or question into a
  fact. Earlier turns may resolve a pronoun, but are not new evidence here.
- Every element must use the exact focus turn id as evidence_turn_id.
- "subjects" names who/what the fact is about (e.g. ["person-name"],
  ["personal-jarvis"]). The caller supplies the speaker's exact user slug.
  For a first-person fact about a named place, person, organization, project,
  asset, vehicle, or recurring activity, include BOTH the exact user slug and
  the named topic slug. Example: "I live in San Francisco" uses kind "place"
  and subjects ["<user-slug>", "san-francisco"].
