"""FastAPI ``/ws/audio`` route for the browser-microphone voice bridge (B2 slice 2).

A per-connection WebSocket that receives raw int16 PCM (binary frames) + JSON
control frames from the browser and runs a :class:`BrowserVoiceSession`
(STT -> Brain -> TTS, no sounddevice). Mirrors the telephony ``/media`` route's
provider resolution (shared STT/TTS + a per-connection brain, with a test-factory
seam) and the ``/ws`` AP-20 receive-loop discipline: a ``RuntimeError`` on an
unclean disconnect is terminal — ``break``, never ``continue``.
