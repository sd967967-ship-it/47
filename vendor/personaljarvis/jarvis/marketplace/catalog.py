"""Plugin Marketplace catalog schema.

Loaded from `data/plugin_catalog.json` at server startup and re-served to
the frontend via `/api/marketplace/plugins`. Five auth modes are modelled
today; each is its own Pydantic submodel and `AuthConfig` is a
discriminated union over the `mode` field.

Packaging policy: new marketplace plugins are submitted in the Agent
Plugins v1.0.0 format (https://agent-plugins.org/) and the existing
entries migrate to it — see docs/marketplace/agent-plugins-standard.md
for the field mapping and the per-plugin migration tracker before adding
or changing a catalog entry.
