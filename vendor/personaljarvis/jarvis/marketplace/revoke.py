"""Best-effort token revocation at the provider on disconnect.

Removing a plugin used to delete only the LOCAL token: the authorization stayed
alive in the user's account at the provider, showing "Personal Jarvis" as a
connected app forever. `revocation_url` has been in the catalog schema (and
populated for Google, Slack and Asana) since the beginning without anything ever
reading it.

Deliberately best-effort and non-blocking for the disconnect itself. Removing
the local credential is the part the user asked for and it must always succeed;
a provider that is unreachable, has already dropped the grant, or does not
implement RFC 7009 must not turn "disconnect" into an error. The outcome is
reported back so the UI can tell the user honestly whether they still need to
visit the provider's own connected-apps page.
