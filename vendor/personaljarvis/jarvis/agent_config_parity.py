"""Give a redirected coding-CLI config dir the user's OWN setup.

An Agentic-IDE pane has to be the same session the user gets by typing
``claude`` or ``codex`` in an ordinary terminal: the same skills, subagents,
slash commands, plugins and connectors, hooks, output styles and user-level
memory file. A pane on the built-in login gets that for free — it spawns with a
plain inherited environment, byte for byte what a terminal would have.

A pane on an ADDED subscription does not. Switching accounts works by pointing
the CLI's own config-dir override (``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` / ``CODEX_HOME``) at a
directory of that account's own (:mod:`jarvis.agent_accounts`) — and that
directory carries the CLI's whole USER LEVEL, not just its login. So the
redirect that buys a second subscription silently costs the user's entire setup.
Measured on a real install (2026-07-27): a pane on an added account saw the
CLI's built-in skills plus the project's ``.claude/`` and nothing else, while
the same CLI in a normal terminal saw 93 user skills, thirteen plugins and the
user's global instructions. That is not a smaller session, it is a different
product — and it is the gap this module closes.

**An explicit allowlist, never a denylist.** Only what a CLI reads as
user-level CONFIGURATION or EXTENSIONS is shared (:data:`USER_SETUP`).
Everything that identifies the account or belongs to its conversations —
``.credentials.json``, ``auth.json``, ``.claude.json``, ``projects/``,
``sessions/``, ``history.jsonl`` — is untouched by construction, because it is
not on the list. That direction matters: sharing a credential file is exactly
the failure the account feature exists to prevent (see
:mod:`jarvis.claude_credentials` — a copied OAuth token starts dying the moment
it is made), whereas a config entry nobody listed yet merely stays missing until
someone adds it.

**Directories are LINKED, single files are MIRRORED.** The difference is not
cosmetic:

* A directory link (symlink, or a junction on Windows where symlinks need a
  privilege) means the pane reads the user's real ``skills/`` folder. A skill
  installed today shows up in every account tomorrow, nothing is duplicated on
  disk, and a plugin the CLI installs from inside a pane lands where the user's
  other terminals will see it. Where no link can be made at all, the tree is
  copied instead — except for entries marked :attr:`Shared.copy_fallback`
  ``False``, which are large and mutable enough (``plugins/``) that a copy would
  be a lie dressed as a feature; those are reported as skipped.
* A single file is COPIED, and deliberately not linked: several components write
  into a config dir with an atomic ``os.replace``, which silently replaces a
  link with a private file. A copy cannot be broken that way. The copy is
  guarded by a digest recorded in :data:`STATE_FILE`, so a later change to the
  user's global file follows through, while a value written for that account —
  by hand, or by the CLI itself inside a pane — is never overwritten.

**Idempotent and self-healing.** It runs before every pane spawn: a few stat
calls when everything is already in place, a re-link when something replaced a
share with a copy, and a repair when a link went dangling because the user
deleted the entry it pointed at.

**Never raises.** A pane must open even when a link cannot be created or a file
cannot be read; every failure degrades to that entry staying unshared, with a
log line naming it. Callers get a :class:`ParityReport` and can say out loud
what did not make it across.

Cross-platform by construction: ``pathlib`` throughout, POSIX symlinks,
Windows junctions where symlink creation is refused, and a copy as the last
resort on any host that allows neither. Nothing here is specific to one OS's
filesystem layout — the entry names come from the CLIs, not from the platform.
