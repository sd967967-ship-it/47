"""ScreenshotSource — primary-monitor screenshot via mss.

Returns an `Observation` with `source="screenshot_only"` (no UIA nodes,
the source is pure image capture). If desired, the PNG blob is stored under
`data/flight_recorder/blobs/<sha256>.png` so the flight recorder can replay
the raw observation.

Important Windows specifics (ADR-0002 plus experience from Phase 1c):

- `SetProcessDpiAwareness(2)` must be called once at init. Without it,
  Windows returns distorted coordinates (virtual instead of physical
  pixels) on 125%/150% scaling setups, which later causes systematic
  misses in `pyautogui.click(x, y)`.
- mss delivers BGRA; Pillow writes PNG from an RGB/RGBA array. We
  convert explicitly so the hash is stable (raw BGRA bytes are not
  portable).

The screenshot is a synchronous, blocking call; we wrap it in
`asyncio.to_thread` so the event loop stays responsive.
