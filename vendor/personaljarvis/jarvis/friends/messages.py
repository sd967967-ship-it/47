"""DirectMessageStore: local persistence for direct messages.

Branch-portable: writes to the same ``friends.db`` as :class:`FriendRegistry`
(no ``board_backend`` sub-project required). A future federation delivery
(Phase F5) can live alongside this as an adapter and reuse the same store
for local history display.

The class does NOT open its own connection — it accepts the open
``aiosqlite.Connection`` from :class:`FriendRegistry` and shares
transactions, WAL mode, and lifecycle with it.
