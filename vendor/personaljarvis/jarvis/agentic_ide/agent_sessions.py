"""How each coding CLI names, keeps and reopens one of its conversations.

A pane of the Agentic IDE is not the conversation it shows. The conversation
lives inside the agent's own CLI — every coding CLI here (Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode, Kimi Code, Grok Build, Antigravity, and the launch profiles over
them) keeps its own history on disk — and all this module does is hold the
one string needed to point back at it: a *resume handle*.

That indirection is what makes a workspace survivable. Closing the browser kills
every agent process (deliberately: an unwatched agent burns tokens invisibly),
and a restarted app forgets the workspace entirely. With a handle per pane, both
can be undone — the pane comes back and so does what it already knows.

The CLIs do NOT work the same way, and the difference decides the design. Two
shapes cover all of them — ASSIGNED at launch, or DISCOVERED afterwards:

* **Claude Code** accepts ``--session-id <uuid>``, so the id can be *assigned*
  at launch. We mint one per pane and hand it over; resuming is then simply
  ``--resume <uuid>``. Unambiguous, no guessing, no filesystem involved.
* **Codex** has no such flag. Its id can only be *discovered* afterwards, from
  the rollout file it writes per session. ``codex resume --last`` looks like a
  shortcut and is a trap: it means "the newest session in this folder", so three
  Codex panes in one repository would all resume the SAME conversation and two
  users' work would silently vanish. Every pane must carry its own id.
* **Grok Build** is the Claude Code shape (``--session-id`` at launch,
  ``--resume`` later); **OpenCode**, **Kimi Code** and **Antigravity** are
  the Codex shape (the id is theirs to choose — a database row, a session
  directory, a conversation UUID — and ours to find by folder and time).
  Each adapter below says which.

Callers never branch on an agent name (AP-21). They ask this module whether a
handle can be minted, spent, or found, and an agent that answers "no" degrades
to a fresh start with an honest message — which is also what any coding CLI
added later gets for free.

Every lookup takes an optional ``home`` — the config directory whose history is
meant. It exists because a pane can run any of several subscriptions of the same
CLI (:mod:`jarvis.agent_accounts`), and each account keeps a SEPARATE history in
its own directory. Without it, a pane on the second account would look for its
transcript in the first account's folder, find nothing, and start fresh with no
sign that anything was lost. ``None`` keeps the old behaviour: the environment
override if one is set, otherwise the CLI's conventional home.

Cross-platform: nothing here is OS-specific. ``CODEX_HOME`` is honoured when
set, otherwise the CLI's conventional home directory is used, and paths are
compared through ``os.path.normcase`` so a drive-letter difference on Windows
does not hide a pane's own session from it.
