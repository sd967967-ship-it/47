"""Folder picking + cheap project profiling for the Agentic IDE.

Two jobs:

*Picking* — the wizard's first step lets the user choose ANY folder on the
machine, so this module lists directories the way a file dialog would, but over
REST (the desktop app is a web UI; a native folder dialog would exist on one OS
and not the others). Start points are discovered per platform: drive letters on
Windows, ``/`` plus the mounted volumes on macOS/Linux, always the home folder
and a handful of conventional code directories.

*Profiling* — once a folder is chosen, Jarvis needs to be able to answer "what
is this codebase?" without reading it file by file. ``probe_project`` collects a
compact profile from a SINGLE shallow directory scan plus a few file-existence
checks: git branch, detected stacks, the agent instruction files that are
actually present, and the skills the repo defines. Deliberately shallow — no
recursive walk — because this runs when a session starts and its result is what
gets folded into the voice turn's context (AP-9: awareness work stays off the
hot path; here it is computed once and cached in the session).
