"""A one-glance answer to "what is this pane actually doing?".

Every pane header used to say the same two things: the call-sign the user chose
and the CLI behind it ("Mika — CLAUDE CODE"). Both are constant for the life of
the pane, so a grid of eight terminals answered the one question a grid of eight
terminals raises — *which of these is doing the thing I care about?* — with
eight identical labels. The information was on screen the whole time, buried in
a full-screen TUI the user has to read pane by pane.

This module derives a short recap from state the workspace already keeps, and
deliberately nothing else:

* what the pane was last **asked** to do (``last_prompt`` — the instruction that
  went in through the prompt bar or by voice),
* what it last **printed** (the readable transcript, already replayed off a
  terminal screen by :mod:`.transcript`),
* whether it is running, starting, dead, or broken, and how long ago it spoke.

No model call, no network, no background task — a recap is computed when someone
asks for one, from a buffer that is filled anyway. That is a hard constraint,
not an optimisation: this text is rendered for every pane of every workspace on
a poll, and an LLM round-trip per pane per few seconds would cost more than the
feature is worth and would fail entirely for a user without a spare key (§3).

Two forms come out, because the header and the tooltip answer differently sized
questions:

* :attr:`Recap.headline` — ONE clause for a label that will be truncated by the
  pane's width. Front-loaded with the freshest signal, since the beginning is
  the part that survives the ellipsis.
* :attr:`Recap.detail` — one or two plain sentences for the hover tooltip: what
  it was asked to do, and what has happened since.

Honest limits: a coding CLI's screen is mostly the CLI's own interface — its
spinner, status bar and input box are redrawn on every frame, and no blacklist
of chrome phrases wins against a TUI that randomizes its spinner verbs. So a
coding pane's HEADLINE never quotes the screen at all: it names the session
from the instruction it was sent, from the first request the user typed into
it, or with a neutral "who, since when" label — while a plain shell, whose
screen is a log rather than an interface, may still cite its newest row. What
the pane last printed stays in the DETAIL, explicitly labelled as a quote.

    # Live. The INSTRUCTION leads, and that ordering was learned the hard way:
    # this used to open with the newest readable row, on the theory that the
    # freshest signal is the most useful one. It is not. The last row of a
    # full-screen coding CLI is a fragment of a sentence it is halfway through
    # printing — or, worse, the CLI's own spinner: panes shipped with headers
    # reading "Churned for 1m 53s" and "2 MCP servers need attention", true
    # quotes of the screen and complete non-answers. So for a coding TUI the
    # headline now NEVER quotes the screen. What names the session, in order:
    # the instruction Jarvis sent, the first request the user typed into the
    # pane themselves, and failing both a neutral "who, since when" label. A
    # plain shell keeps citing its newest row — its screen is a log, not an
    # interface. The row a TUI printed still follows in the tooltip, and the
    # real answer to "what has it achieved" comes from .recap_engine.
    #
    # The job goes in BARE — no "Working on:" prefix and no quotes. The header
    # is a few centimetres wide and clips the end of whatever is in it, so ten
    # characters of framing is ten characters of the answer pushed off the edge;
    # the long form below still says which of the two it is.
