"""Recaps that say what a pane ACHIEVED, not what it last printed.

:mod:`.recap` derives a pane's header label from the terminal replay with string
rules alone. That floor is honest but thin, and the way it fails is worth
stating plainly, because it is the reason this module exists: the last readable
row of a coding CLI is a *fragment*. A pane that had just written a design
document reported "without interrupting Claude's current work" — a true quote of
the screen, and a complete non-answer to the only question a grid of eight
terminals raises.

What the user wants in that header is the thing a coding CLI writes when you ask
it for a recap: the goal, where the work stands, and what is outstanding. That is
a summary of a session, and no amount of line-picking produces one — it needs a
model to read the pane and write a sentence.

So this module puts a summarizer above the floor, and treats the floor as the
fallback rather than as the product:

* **Cached, never on the read path.** ``recap_for`` returns whatever is already
  known — a model recap when one has arrived, the deterministic one until then —
  and returns it immediately. The model call happens in a background task.
* **Refreshed only on a material change, then SETTLED.** A young pane is
  re-summarized as output arrives (at most once per :data:`MIN_REFRESH_S`), but
  once a summary has read a substantial transcript the title stays put: only a
  new instruction or a status change rewrites it (:data:`STABLE_AFTER_LINES`).
  A navigation label that re-words itself while the user glances away cannot be
  recognized again — and a grid that nobody has touched costs nothing at all.
* **Bounded.** At most :data:`MAX_CONCURRENT` summaries are in flight across the
  whole app, each with its own timeout, and a pane whose summaries keep failing
  goes quiet for a while instead of retrying every poll.
* **Optional by construction** (§3). No key, no reachable provider — those
  paths end at the deterministic recap, which is exactly what the pane showed
  before this module existed. A provider that fails at CALL time (a depleted
  key's 429, a 402) first crosses to the next provider FAMILY in the resolver
  chain (AP-22), then to a connected coding subscription (the CLI in the panes
  is a credential too), and only then falls back to the deterministic floor.
  Nothing here is load-bearing, and nothing here may raise into a state read.

Above the model sits one more layer, and it outranks both: **what the user
wrote themselves**. No summarizer can know that a pane is "the branch I'm about
to demo" or "leave this one alone", so the pencil in the pane header writes
straight into :func:`pin`, the written text wins, and the background summarizer
stops spending requests on that pane until it is cleared again.

Every recap also carries a ``reason`` — which layer wrote it and, when it is the
deterministic floor, *why* the model did not. Each of those codes was already a
silent early return in :func:`refresh_soon`; naming them is what turns "this
recap is thin and nobody knows why" into a sentence in the recap card.

The recap is written in the INTERFACE language (``[ui].language``), not the
voice/chat reply language: it is a label sitting among the workspace's other
labels, and a German sentence between English buttons is the inconsistency, not
the fix.

_SYSTEM = """\
You write a navigation label and recap for one terminal pane in a multi-agent \
coding workspace. The user is glancing across a grid and must recognize the \
ORIGINAL USER GOAL of this pane immediately, without reading its terminal.

You are given the instruction the pane was last sent and a readable replay of \
its terminal screen. That screen belongs to a coding CLI, so it also contains \
the CLI's own interface — banners, menus, spinners, key hints, a token \
counter, and the text on its input line, which is what the USER typed. Read \
past all of that to the work itself.

Answer with exactly two physical lines and nothing else:

HEADLINE: <about 5 words, HARD MAXIMUM 48 characters. A self-contained \
navigation label for the user's problem or desired outcome, normally \
"subject — result". No pane name, agent name, quotation marks, or trailing \
period.>
DETAIL: <exactly two complete sentences on this same physical line. State the \
original goal first, then what has been achieved, what is blocked, or the next \
step. Finish both sentences.>

Rules:
- THE FIRST TWO WORDS MUST IDENTIFY THIS PANE ON THEIR OWN. Narrow sidebars \
truncate the headline after roughly two words, so they are often ALL the user \
sees. Front-load the most specific noun phrase this session has — the feature, \
the bug, the subsystem — and push everything generic behind it. Test yourself: \
if the first two words could open the headline of a DIFFERENT session in the \
same workspace, they are too generic.
- Never OPEN with a bare activity name ("Code Review", "Bug Fix", "Refactor", \
"Research") or process narration such as "Investigating", "Implementing", \
"Working on", "Fixing", "Analyzing", "Reviewing", or an equivalent phrase in \
the requested language. Name WHAT is being reviewed or fixed first; the \
activity may follow after it if room remains.
- The headline answers "Which user problem or outcome is this pane for?", not \
"Which generic engineering activity is happening?" Use the user's vocabulary \
when the original request is visible; otherwise infer the outcome cautiously \
from the work.
- Aim for about 5 words. Shorter is acceptable only when the subject genuinely \
needs fewer; never pad, never exceed 48 characters.
- Keep file paths, class names, commands and implementation mechanisms OUT of \
the headline. Put useful technical evidence in DETAIL instead.
- Be concrete in DETAIL. "Working on the code" is worthless. Name supported \
errors, findings, decisions and results there.
- If the pane is waiting for the user — a permission prompt, a question, a \
choice between options — lead with "Needs input" (translated) in both lines. \
It is the one thing the user has to act on.
- Never quote the CLI's status bar, key hints, token or context counter, \
spinner text, or the contents of its input line.
- Say only what the screen supports. If it shows no real work yet, say that \
plainly instead of inventing some.
- Report, do not address the user, and do not offer help. No preamble, no \
markdown, no bullet points, no code fences.

Headline examples (poor -> useful). Note how the first two words alone \
already say which session this is:
- "Code Review — 6 findings" -> \
"Pane titles review — 6 findings"
- "Consolidating the workspace launcher into a single screen" -> \
"Workspace setup — one clear screen"
- "Fixing three bugs in the terminal notification system" -> \
"Terminal alerts — 3 reliability fixes"
- "Implementing terminal tab renaming based on workspace renaming" -> \
"Terminal tabs — rename without restart"
- "Investigating terminal pane geometry and whitespace" -> \
"Terminal panes — reclaim wasted space"\
