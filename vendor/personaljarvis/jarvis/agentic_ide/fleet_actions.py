    Every CLI observed so far swallows a prompt that arrives while it is still
    booting — the keystrokes go nowhere and the user is told the work was sent.
    So waiting for a real input line is the DEFAULT, and an entry only skips it
    by declaring so: one CLI has a launch-and-prompt path measured to be stable
    without the wait, and making it wait would slow down behaviour that already
    works.

    Getting that default the wrong way round is what a new provider cannot
    afford. Opting in silently means every CLI registered later loses its first
    prompt until somebody notices; opting out silently costs one CLI a little
    speed. The cheap mistake is the one worth defaulting to.
