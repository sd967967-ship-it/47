"""The operating system's own folder dialog, for picking a workspace.

Browsing folders over REST works everywhere and stays the only option on a
headless box, but on a real desktop it is the wrong tool for one specific job:
finding a folder you know by sight rather than by name. The system dialog
already has the sidebar, the search, the recent places and the muscle memory —
rebuilding a worse copy of it inside a web page helps nobody.

So both exist. The REST browser is the floor; this is the shortcut when the
machine can actually show a window.

**Every dialog runs in its own short-lived process.** Not an optimisation — a
requirement, three times over:

1. A window toolkit demands a thread state the web server does not have: a
   single-threaded apartment on Windows, the main thread on macOS. A subprocess
   gets to be both.
2. A modal dialog blocks until someone answers it. In-process that would pin a
   worker for as long as the user leaves it open.
3. A wedged dialog must be *recoverable*, not merely bounded. A hung thread
   cannot be cancelled in Python — killing a child process can (AP-24).

**Availability is probed, never assumed from the platform.** ``sys.platform ==
"linux"`` says nothing about whether a screen exists; a container, an SSH
session and a VPS all report the same platform as a desktop. The probe asks for
the two things that actually matter — a display and a program that can draw the
dialog — and every OS without both degrades to an honest "not available here",
which is what keeps the REST browser the advertised path.

# Windows has TWO folder dialogs and the difference matters here.
#
# `FolderBrowserDialog` — the one every PowerShell snippet reaches for — is the
# small tree from Windows XP: no address bar, no search, no way to type or paste
# a path, and no Quick Access. Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs on .NET Framework,
# where that is the ONLY thing it can be; the modern version of that class ships
# with .NET Core and never reached the Framework.
#
# The dialog people mean when they say "the Explorer window" is the Common Item
# Dialog (`IFileOpenDialog` with the pick-folders option) — the same one Explorer
# and every modern app use, with the sidebar, the address bar, search, and typed
# paths. It is a COM interface, not a .NET class, so it is declared here and used
# directly. That declaration is the fragile part (the method order IS the binary
# contract), which is why the whole thing sits in a try/catch that falls back to
# the old tree rather than failing: an outdated dialog still picks a folder.
#
# `-STA` is mandatory either way — the shell dialogs refuse to run in a
# multi-threaded apartment — and the invisible topmost owner form exists only to
# lend its z-order, because a dialog opened by a background process otherwise
# appears behind every other window and looks like nothing happened.
#
# The owner is a one-pixel borderless form, NOT a full-size form with
# `Opacity = 0`: Windows silently drops WS_EX_TOPMOST from a layered window that
# is completely transparent, so an opacity-0 owner is not topmost at all, the
# dialog it owns is not either, and behind a maximised app window the picker is
# invisible — exactly the "Browse does nothing" report. A faint 1x1 window keeps
# the flag (measured: 0.01 keeps it, 0 loses it). It sits in the middle of the
# screen the mouse is on, because the dialog centres itself over its owner and
# the mouse is where the person just clicked "Browse".
