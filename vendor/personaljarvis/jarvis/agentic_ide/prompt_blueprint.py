"""What a composed prompt looks like, and what it is allowed to say.

Every rule here is traceable to the vendors' own prompting documentation,
because the thing this module replaces was a plausible-sounding prompt that
made the receiving agent behave *worse*:

* **Goal and constraints, never the implementation.** The single most
  load-bearing rule, and the one the first version got backwards. Measured
  live 2026-07-27: asked to make composition faster, the composer wrote "use
  non-blocking background tasks for writer resolution" — it handed the agent a
  solution that was *already implemented*, so the agent's task became
  re-doing finished work. Every current frontier guide converges here: state
  what good looks like and the bounds, and let the model choose the route.
  Enumerated steps measurably REDUCE output quality on Fable 5, and leaner
  system prompts score higher on agentic coding evaluations while costing a
  fraction of the tokens.
* **The handover is not the work.** The instruction arrives as speech aimed at
  Jarvis, so it names the handover as well as the task: "prompt T2 and T3 to
  …", "write Alex the prompt for …", "tell Nova it should …". THIS BRIEF IS
  THAT PROMPT. Measured live 2026-07-29, on an order that translates as "write
  the prompt for T2 and T3, and make sure that …": the brief's ``## Task`` read
  "Create or update the system prompts for terminals T2 and T3" — two coding
  agents were sent off to write prompts for themselves, and the analysis the
  user actually asked for reached nobody. The work is what follows the
  handover; writing a prompt is the task only when the user is talking about
  prompt TEXT that lives in the repository.
* **Resolve what the agent cannot see.** A spoken instruction refers back into
  the conversation it came out of — "points two and three", "the second one",
  "do that for the wake path too" — and the agent receives the brief alone.
  The same live composition wrote "Ensure that points 2 and 3 from the current
  context are specifically incorporated": a pointer to something the recipient
  can never open, which is worth exactly as much as writing nothing. The
  recent turns travel with the instruction (``conversation``) so the reference
  can be replaced by what it stands for.
* **A lean brief, not a map of the code.** Complete means the agent has the
  task and the starting ``@files``, not that the writer narrated how those
  files work. The agent opens them. A 1400-2400 character specification
  (2026-07-27) cost 10-30 s of thinking and then made the agent re-read the
  same files; the 2026-08-18 mandate is 1-5 s, cleaned speech plus key files.
* **Scope lives in the task, not in a prohibition list.** The first version
  listed what the agent must not do (no surrounding cleanup, no unrequested
  refactors, no speculative abstractions). Anthropic's own measured
  replacement is an intent instruction — deliver what was asked at the
  scope intended — which cut scope drift without extra clarifying questions.
* **No verification ritual.** "If your prompt contains explicit verification
  instructions … remove them: instructions like these cause over-verification
  … and removing them reduces wasted tokens with no loss in quality." Success
  *criteria* stay; "double-check afterwards" is banned.
* **No reasoning echo.** Asking an agent to reproduce its internal reasoning
  can trigger the ``reasoning_extraction`` refusal category on Fable 5.
* **Say each thing exactly once.** A rule repeated in two sections is not
  twice as followed; it is noise that dilutes the rules that matter, and it is
  paid for on every composition in latency the user waits through.
* **Per-kind guardrails.** The clearest case: on a review, "only report
  high-severity issues" is followed literally and suppresses real findings. On
  an investigation the opposite steer is right — report, do not fix. One
  coherent rule set per kind beats one long contradictory one, so ``task_kind``
  picks the set and only that set is injected.

The composed prompt is always English. The recipient is a coding agent working
in a repository whose artifacts are English (CLAUDE.md §1); a prompt in the
spoken language pulls same-language commit messages and comments after it. The
*spoken readback* to the user is unaffected — that stays in the turn's
resolved output language.

not double-check". Write neither.
- Its own reasoning. No "explain your reasoning", "show your thinking" or \
"narrate your steps", and equally no instruction forbidding those. Write \
neither. (A line like "Do not narrate your internal reasoning" in the finished \
prompt is this rule being LEAKED instead of followed - it is a defect.)"""

_SHARED_RULES = f"""\
You turn a spoken instruction into a brief for a coding agent (Claude Code or \
Codex) already running inside the user's repository. The agent will act on what \
you write, so write the brief you would want to receive.

{GOAL_NOT_IMPLEMENTATION_RULE}

The user is SPEAKING to Jarvis about this agent, so their words name the \
handover as well as the work: "prompt T2 and T3 to ...", "write Alex the prompt \
for ...", "tell Nova it should ...". THE BRIEF YOU ARE WRITING IS THAT PROMPT. \
Never make prompt-writing the agent's task - a `## Task` reading "create the \
prompt for T2" sends the agent off to do your job and loses the one thing the \
user asked for. The work is whatever the sentence asks for AROUND the handover. \
(The exception is narrow and unmistakable: the user is talking about prompt \
text that lives in the repository as a file.)

The brief is ALL the agent gets. It sees no conversation, no earlier answer, no \
"context" of any kind, so anything the user said by pointing back - "points two \
and three", "the second option", "what you just suggested", "that one" - must \
be REPLACED by what it stands for, spelled out from the conversation you were \
given. A brief that forwards the pointer instead ("incorporate points 2 and 3 \
from the current context") gives the agent nothing it can act on. If a \
reference cannot be resolved from what you were given, write what IS known and \
leave the unresolvable part out rather than pointing at it.

Markdown, exactly this skeleton:

{_SKELETON}

- Output ONLY the brief: no preamble, no code fence, no quotes.
- `## Task` is mandatory; every other section is OPTIONAL. Omit any you cannot \
ground rather than padding it.

INVENTING is forbidden: a requirement, constraint, boundary or success \
criterion the user did not state and the workspace does not establish. `## Done \
when` holds only what the user asked for or what the repository itself \
determines (its test command, its lint gate). Omit it otherwise. Do not add a \
`## Scope` or `## How it works today` section - the agent will open the @files \
and discover the current code itself.

- Aim for {TARGET_MIN_CHARS}-{TARGET_MAX_CHARS} characters, never over \
{MAX_BODY_CHARS}. Length comes from a clean task and a concrete Key files \
list, never from restating the files' internals, hedging or dictated steps.
- `@path` references only inside `## Key files`, only paths that appear in the \
workspace tree (join a directory header with the file name under it), each \
with one short reason. Never invent a path. Never end the prompt on an \
`@path` or `/command` - a trailing reference holds the agent's completion \
popup open and the prompt is never submitted.
- ENGLISH, whatever language the user spoke.
- Preserve every constraint, file, symbol and intent expressed; drop speech \
artefacts and the clause addressing the agent by name.
