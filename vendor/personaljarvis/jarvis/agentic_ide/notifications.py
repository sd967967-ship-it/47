"""Tell the user when a pane stopped needing them to watch it.

## The gap this closes

A workspace runs up to a dozen coding agents at once, in panes the size of a
postcard. Each of them works for anything between twenty seconds and half an
hour, and none of them says when it is done — the spinner row simply stops
being drawn. So the only way to know that the agent you are waiting for has
finished is to keep looking at the wall, and the actual outcome is that work
sits finished and unread for as long as it takes the user to notice.

This module watches every pane in every open workspace, notices the moment one
stops working, and files a short entry saying so. The bell in the IDE header
carries the count; the panel behind it lists the entries and jumps to the pane
that raised each one.

## What it will and will not claim

Four kinds, and each one is something the pane itself established:

* ``completed`` — it was given a job, it was working, and it is not any more.
* ``needs_input`` — it is not working and there is a question on its screen.
* ``exited`` — its process is gone (with the exit code, if there was one).
* ``failed`` — its agent could not be started at all.

Nothing here reads the agent's prose to decide whether the job went well: a
"completed" entry means the pane went quiet, never that the work is correct.
That distinction is in the wording the UI shows, because promising the second
one would be a lie the module is in no position to tell.

## Why "completed" needs a job as well as a stop

The detector underneath reads MOVEMENT (see :mod:`.activity`), and a coding CLI
moves plenty on its own account. Starting up it paints a banner, a model line
and whatever warnings it carries, then stands still — which is, frame for
frame, what an agent finishing a job looks like. So the first version of this
rang the bell once per pane the moment a workspace opened, twice for the panes
whose startup drawing arrived in two bursts, before anybody had typed a word.

A stop is therefore only reported once the pane has been GIVEN something to do:
a prompt from Jarvis, or a person pressing Enter in it
(``Terminal.last_submit_at``). The flag latches — a pane in service stays in
service — because the thing it rules out is the period BEFORE the first
instruction, not the second job. The other three kinds are unconditional: a
question, a dead process and a failed start are news whether or not the pane
ever worked.

## Why a debounce, and why it is the whole trick

A coding TUI drops its interrupt hint for a moment between steps — while it
waits for a permission answer, or repaints between tool calls. Reporting the
first frame in which the hint is absent would file "finished" several times per
minute for a pane that is working normally. So a pane has to have been settled
for :data:`SETTLE_S` before anything is filed, and the flag is armed once per
episode: an agent that goes back to work re-arms it, and one that sits at its
prompt for an hour is reported once.

## What is and is not persisted

An entry's whole value is the "jump to pane" behind it. Panes do not survive a
restart of the app, so a notification that did would point at a terminal that
no longer exists — the one thing worse than no notification. The store is a
bounded deque and is deliberately lost with the process.

The same reasoning inside one run: every sweep tells the store which panes are
still there (:meth:`NotificationCenter.retain`), and entries whose pane has been
closed go with it. A pane closed by name is cleared on the spot instead
(:meth:`NotificationCenter.forget_pane`), because its call-sign — and with it
its KEY — is handed straight back out to whatever opens next. That sweep is
also where a live pane's call-sign is refreshed, so an entry cannot go on naming
a terminal the user has since renamed.

One boolean does survive: whether a pane was observed actively working. The
resume snapshot uses that evidence to distinguish genuinely interrupted work
from a conversation that had already finished or was awaiting an answer.

## Where it runs

One sweep task per registry, started when the first workspace opens and
finishing by itself once the last one closes (AP-26: nothing new on the boot
path — with no workspace open, nothing here runs at all). The poll itself reads
each pane's replayed screen, which is a list of at most a few dozen strings, so
a dozen panes cost microseconds every couple of seconds.

#: The other half of the tool-step problem ``WORK_RESUME_GRACE_S`` solved. That

#: published: the raw reading flips to ``waiting`` the moment a pane has stood
#: still for ``STILL_S``, so every pause longer than that — a slow tool call,
#: the model's own think time, the redraw shadow of a resize — turned the
#: session's badge into a finished dot for a sweep or two and restarted its
#: clock. The maintainer watched a pane whose own spinner read "11m 00s" wear
#: "Working for 7s" beside it (2026-08-27), and a row of twenty sessions
#: flickered between busy and done for work that never stopped.
#:
#: So a pane that WAS working is only called stopped once it has held still
#: for this long past the raw flip — the same window the bell already waits
#: (``SETTLE_S``) before announcing the stop. One number for both on purpose:
#: the badge is the thing the bell points at, and it must never say "done"
#: after the bell has already said so. Cost: a finished pane shows its dot
