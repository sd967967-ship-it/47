"""Durable readback of every prompt handed to an Agentic-IDE pane.

The workspace snapshot intentionally stays metadata-only because it is read on
the IDE's first screen and may describe hundreds of panes. Full prompts live in
separate append-only JSONL files instead: writing one prompt does not rewrite a
large history, and opening the history is the only operation that reads it.

Files are keyed by an opaque pane-lifetime id, never by a user-provided call-sign
or folder path. Renaming a pane therefore keeps its history, while closing it
and later reusing the same visible name cannot inherit somebody else's prompts.
