"""What the agent actually said, read from the CLI's own record of it.

## Why not read the screen

A pane shows a TUI, and a TUI is a picture. It repaints rows in place, wraps to
the window it happened to have, draws its own logo, and prints spinners and
status lines that mean nothing an hour later. Anything that turns that picture
back into a conversation is guessing — and it guesses wrong in the way that
matters most: a line it does not recognise is either dropped (so real output
vanishes) or kept (so ``Philosophising…`` and a half-drawn banner become part of
the transcript). Both were on screen at once in the report this module answers.

But the conversation is not only on the screen. Every coding CLI worth resuming
already writes it down — that record is what :mod:`.agent_sessions` points a
resume handle at — and it is *structured*: roles are declared, tool calls carry
their name and their arguments, prose is prose. So this reads THAT, and the
guessing stops.

## What it produces

One shape for every CLI: an ordered list of :class:`Turn`, each a role, its
text, and the :class:`Step` s the agent took inside it. Callers never branch on
which product wrote the file (AP-21) — they ask for a transcript and get either
one or ``None``, and ``None`` means "this CLI keeps no readable record", which
the surface answers by showing the live pane instead. A CLI added later gets the
same deal for free by registering an adapter.

## Bounds

Two, both load-bearing. A conversation view answers with the last
:data:`MAX_TURNS` exchanges, cut at a person's message and never inside one —
a turn is shown from what was asked, or not at all. The file is streamed from
its head, one line at a time, to find those turns: a pane given one long task
has its question at the HEAD of the file and megabytes of tool output after
it, and a read that started from the end and stopped short came back with the
answer's torso and no question (BUG-196). A line-by-line pass over a
20-megabyte record costs a tenth of a second, less than decoding a fixed tail
as one block did; :data:`MAX_READ_BYTES` only keeps a runaway file from being
walked whole on every poll. And each block of text is capped, because a tool
result can be a whole file and this is a conversation, not a file viewer.

Cross-platform: paths come from :mod:`.agent_sessions`, everything is read as
UTF-8 with replacement, and nothing here is OS-specific.

# log of :mod:`jarvis.agent_chat.events`. So a pane's transcript is offered in

# folds a terminal's, and the Agentic IDE can put a running CLI on the chat
# stage without a second renderer that would drift from the first.

# runners cut them: everything the agent did after one and before the next is
# one turn. Timestamps come from the records, so a thought's duration is the
# gap to whatever the agent wrote next, and a tool result is timed from its
# call. Nothing here guesses at a clock the file does not carry.
