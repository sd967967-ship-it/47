"""Files dropped or pasted onto a terminal pane.

A native terminal takes a dragged file and writes its PATH into the prompt.
A browser cannot: for security it hands a web page the file's BYTES and never
its location. That is the whole reason dropping a screenshot onto an agent pane
did nothing — the pane had no drop handler, and a handler alone would not have
been enough, because what the coding agent needs is a path it can open.

So a drop takes one of two routes, and the caller picks by what it actually has:

1. **The path came along.** Dragging out of Explorer or Finder usually puts the
   real path in the drag payload (``text/uri-list``). Nothing is copied — the
   path is typed straight into the agent. This is the common case for "look at
   this file in my project".
2. **Only bytes.** A screenshot pasted from the clipboard, an image dragged off
   a web page, a file from a sandboxed source. Those are written into the
   workspace here, and the path of the written copy is what the agent gets.

Why the copies land INSIDE the workspace rather than in a temp directory: a
coding agent's file access is scoped, and how it treats an absolute path from
somewhere else varies by agent, by version, and by the user's permission
settings. Betting on that would make the feature work on the maintainer's
machine and prompt-or-fail on someone else's. A path inside the folder the user
opened needs no permission from anyone.

The drop directory hides itself from git by carrying its own ``.gitignore`` with
``*`` in it — so a dropped screenshot never shows up in the user's `git status`
and we never touch their repository configuration to achieve that.
