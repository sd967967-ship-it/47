"""Who writes an Agentic IDE brief — one order, both call sites.

The prompt composer and the work splitter each used to carry their own copy of
this decision. They must never diverge: a user who moves briefs onto their
subscription and then finds the splitter still billing an API key has been told
one thing and charged for another.

The order, and why each rung is where it is:

1. **A pin is a pin.** ``api`` never touches a subscription — a user who chose
   the API tier must not have their plan quota spent behind their back — and a
   named provider, ``tool_model`` or ``subscription`` never quietly falls back
   to the API key, which is the same surprise in the other direction. An
   unhonourable pin degrades to the caller's deterministic layer, which is at
   least honest.
2. **``tool_model`` means the model the user already chose**, in the Tool Model
   tab, for work the assistant does on its own behalf. It resolves through
   ``resolve_tool_model_brain`` and nowhere else: a Tool Model pin that quietly
   landed on a coding CLI would make the setting meaningless.
3. **``auto`` prefers the writer that answers soonest**: the pinned Tool
   Model first, then the API-billed quality tier, then a connected coding
   subscription. A brief written for a SPOKEN instruction sits on the voice
   turn's critical path — the user is standing there, waiting for the text to
   land in the pane — and a subscription CLI pays a cold process start before
   it thinks at all. Measured live 2026-08-18 16:10: the CLI wrote a 1248-char
   brief in 18.9 s, nearly all of it the spawn (an EMPTY answer from the same
   CLI took 17-19 s in the same minute, against 5-6 s an hour earlier — the
   start-up cost triples under load), while the Tool Model on the same box
   wrote the same brief in 5 s warm. Until 2026-08-18 ``auto`` put the subscription
   first because it is work the user has already paid for; it now writes under
   ``auto`` only when nothing API-side qualifies — an install whose ONLY
   credential is a coding CLI still gets its brief — and a user who wants the
   plan spent on purpose pins ``subscription``. The Tool Model rung leads
   because it is, by the Tool Model tab's own words, the model that "routes
   spoken commands and starts background agents": a spoken instruction to a
   pane is exactly that work.
4. **Nothing qualifies → ``(None, "")``**, and the caller says so.

The distinction users actually make here is "an API key I pay per token for"
versus "a coding CLI I already subscribe to" — and which CLI that is differs
per install. Nothing in this module names a vendor: the subscription rung asks
the provider cards which providers bill that way (AP-21/22), so whichever CLI
the user connected is the one that writes.

**Choosing a writer and surviving one are different questions**
(``resolve_rescue_writer``). The order above answers "who should write this",
and a pin that cannot be honoured there degrades openly — that half is
unchanged. What it does NOT answer is what happens when the chosen writer
accepts the job and dies inside it: a depleted key answering 429, a CLI
returning its own flag error on stdout, a provider timing out. Measured on the
dev box 2026-08-02: the writer resolved to a key whose prepayment credits were
gone, so EVERY composition ended on the raw spoken sentence while a signed-in
subscription sat unused. Treating a runtime failure as "the user gets no
brief" is the single-provider brick AP-22 exists to forbid, so a dead call
crosses to the next rung instead. That is not a silent substitution: the
composer names the writer that ended up writing, and the rung that died.

Never raises. Every failure here costs a rougher prompt; none of them may cost
the user their instruction.

#: How long one successful resolution answers for everybody. Resolving costs a
#: config load plus a sign-in probe per candidate CLI (~0.5-1 s, run per PANE of

#: sign-out, a settings change. Failures are never cached — a user who just
#: fixed their key must not wait out a stale "nothing qualifies".
#:
#: Ten minutes, raised from 45 s (2026-08-12): every path that CHANGES the
#: answer already invalidates explicitly — the settings PUT calls
#: ``invalidate_writer_cache`` and a failed call invalidates through
#: ``resolve_rescue_writer`` — so the TTL only guards against a change nothing
#: announced (a CLI signed out behind the app's back). The worst case there is
#: one failed attempt that immediately crosses rungs; the 45 s version bought
#: that narrow safety by re-paying the probes on nearly every compose after an

#: up is the exact leak ``resolve_subscription_brain`` documents against.

#: A SINGLE slot, on purpose. Every production caller passes the same

#: site with a different budget would make the two alternate on the slot and
