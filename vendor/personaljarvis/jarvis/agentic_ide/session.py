"""In-process state of the Agentic-IDE workspaces.

One registry holds several *sessions*, one of which is *active*. A session is a
chosen folder plus N named terminals, each running a coding-agent CLI (Claude
Code / Codex) in a real pseudo-terminal rooted in that folder. The registry is
what makes the feature more than an embedded terminal grid — it is the thing
Jarvis reads from and writes to:

* **reads** — every terminal keeps a sanitized transcript, so "what is Mika
  doing?" is answered from what Mika actually printed, not from a guess,
* **writes** — a prompt can be injected into a terminal from the outside
  (voice, chat, CLI), which is how you talk to an agent without touching the
  keyboard.

Only one workspace is on screen at a time, and ``session`` — the property every
other layer reads — is always that one. Voice, the brain's context, the prompt
composer and the CLI therefore keep asking exactly one question ("the workspace
I am looking at") and never had to learn that there are others.

**A workspace lives until it is closed.** Looking away is not closing: the panes
of a workspace you switched off stay attached to their running agents, which is
the entire point of having more than one. Only ``end`` (and app shutdown) stops
an agent, and every open workspace is visible in the UI's workspace bar — so
nothing runs unwatched in a way the user cannot see. Coming back re-binds the
running PTY instead of restarting it, and replays the pane's raw output so the
screen is the one you left (see ``attach`` and ``ReplayBuffer``).

Security posture of the write path (this is a keystroke channel into a running
process, so it is bounded deliberately):

1. The PTY runs the AGENT, never a persistent shell. When the agent exits the
   PTY dies with it, the terminal flips to ``exited``, and injection is refused
   — so an injected prompt can never fall through into a live shell prompt and
   be executed as a command.
2. Injected text is stripped of every C0 control character. Voice can therefore
   not send Ctrl-C, ESC, or EOF: it cannot kill the agent, break out of its TUI,
   or drive its keyboard shortcuts — only type a prompt and press Enter.
3. Length is capped, and Enter is sent as a separate write a beat later,
   because agent TUIs treat an instant text+newline burst as a paste and insert
   a literal line break instead of submitting.

**A pane is the user's own CLI, not a stripped copy of it.** Whatever the user
gets by typing ``claude`` or ``codex`` in a terminal — their skills, subagents,
slash commands, plugins and connectors, hooks, output styles, global
instructions, default mode — a pane gets too. That is free while the CLI keeps
its own configuration directory, and it is NOT free for a pane running on an
added subscription, because switching accounts works by redirecting exactly that
directory (see ``_spawn_env`` and :mod:`jarvis.agent_config_parity`). Anything
this module opens must close that gap rather than ship a second, quieter version
of the CLI the user installed.

Platform notes: the PTY layer itself is already cross-platform behind
``jarvis.terminal.backend`` (ConPTY on Windows, ptyprocess on POSIX, a clearly
messaged no-op where no PTY exists). What this module adds per platform is
resolving the agent binary: npm installs it as a ``.cmd``/``.ps1`` shim on
Windows. Codex is launched through absolute ``node.exe`` + ``codex.js`` paths
there: ``cmd.exe`` drops inherited environment variables longer than 8,191
characters, so an npm batch shim cannot find Node when the app has a large
PATH. Other batch shims use a one-shot ``cmd /c`` (so rule 1 above still holds).

# grid (see MIN_VIEWER_COLS) is clipped at the tile edge, which is how six panes
# each came to show two thirds of themselves and read as overlapping one

# than the window showing it, which the maintainer read as terminals shoved

# most of them through ``npx``, which resolves a package before it runs one.
# Measured on this install: eleven user-scope servers, roughly two and a half
# processes each. Eight panes therefore meant well over two hundred process
# starts inside a second or two — every core pinned, the machine unresponsive,
# and the app itself too starved to draw the panes it was starting.
#
# The work is the same either way; only its SHAPE changes. Panes past the limit
# wait for a slot, so the same workspace opens as a rolling start that leaves
# the machine usable, and the pane the user is looking at is up immediately
# rather than last-of-eight in a freeze.

# enough to stagger, short enough that nobody watches a spinner for it.
#
# That is the FLOOR. The slot is actually held until the pane shows its input
# line — the moment the CLI has finished loading — or until COLD_START_HOLD_MAX_S,
# whichever comes first. A fixed second was the whole gate on a machine that
# had booted a minute earlier: eight resumed Claude Code panes went from
# "spawned" to "loading" within two seconds of each other, each one reading a
# session transcript and starting its MCP servers off a cold disk, and the app

        The panes come back with their call-signs, their coding CLIs, their grid
        coordinates and their resume handles — and in ``pending``, because
        spawning is not this method's job. The grid attaches its panes the way it
        always does, and ``attach`` spends the handles. That keeps ONE place
        where an agent is started; a second spawn path here would drift from it
        the first time either changed. It is also why restoring several
        workspaces is cheap: none of them launches anything until a pane
        connects, and only the workspace on screen has panes mounted.

        All of the last session rather than the front one, because "resume all
        sessions" is what was asked for and somebody with four folders open had
        four — but the LAST SESSION, not the whole file. The store deliberately
        remembers folders closed days ago so a new workspace cannot erase them
        (``resume_store._merged_with_stored``); reopening that archive wholesale
        is what made a restart come back with Tuesday's folders beside today's,
        every one of them carrying the same call-signs out of the same pool, so
        the deduplicator renamed the collisions into "Alex 2" / "Alex 3" and the
        result read as "it duplicated my terminals". ``last_session`` is the
        line between the two; the older folders stay on offer and are reopened
        from the picker, one deliberate click at a time.

        Restoring the same restore point TWICE is a no-op for whatever it
        already brought back. A workspace remembers which record it came from,
        so a stale offer card in a second window cannot open a duplicate of a
        workspace that is on screen right now.

        A workspace that cannot come back does not stop the others: a deleted
        folder is reported with a reason. What could not be restored comes back
        in ``skipped`` so the
        caller can say so out loud instead of quietly returning less than it
        promised. A folder that is already open in a workspace opened by hand is
        NOT one of those cases — two workspaces may share a folder deliberately,
        and the remembered one comes back beside the live one rather than
        replacing agents that are working.

        A pane whose CLI is no longer installed IS restored. It shows up as an
        error the moment it tries to connect, which is a far better outcome than
        silently dropping a terminal the user expects to see.

        rare race but the ordinary case (a restored workspace reconnects every

        socket). See ``Terminal.attach_lock`` for what walking through that gap

        asks for. ``_attach_locked`` resolves again under the lock, because the

        and ``term.pty_id`` being recorded at the end is what a second
        concurrent attach used to start a duplicate agent through.

        ``on_output(text)`` / ``on_exit(code)`` are awaited in this loop. The
        transcript is fed here, so it keeps filling even if the UI pane is
        closed and reconnects later.

        ``appearance`` is the light/dark ground the viewer draws this pane on.
        It is answered to the agent's CLI when it asks for the screen colours,
        so a CLI on a light pane picks a palette for paper rather than for
        slate. Omitted (an internal re-attach), whatever the last viewer said
        stands.

        **A running agent is re-joined, never restarted.** A pane whose PTY is
        still alive — the normal case after switching workspaces, reloading the
        browser, or coming back to the section — hands its output to the new
        viewer and replays what it has been printing meanwhile, so the screen
        comes back as it was. Restarting instead would throw away work in
        progress every time somebody looked away, which is precisely what having
        several workspaces would otherwise cost.

        A replay is valid only at the geometry that produced its cursor moves.
        When the viewer comes back at another size, the old drawing is replaced
        by its terminal-mode prologue and a live repaint. This is still the same
        process and conversation; only the stale pixels are discarded.

        **That replay goes out on ``on_replay``, not on ``on_output``, because a
        viewer has to CLEAR its screen before drawing it.** The two are the same
        bytes and completely different instructions: live output continues a
        screen, a replay REBUILDS one. A viewer that appended it instead drew
        the agent's interface a second time over the copy already there — and
        because an Ink TUI skips unchanged cells with cursor moves rather than
        overwriting them with spaces, the two copies did not stack tidily, they
        interleaved character by character ("plus everything new" came back as
        "plueverythingwnew"). Reported 2026-07-29 across three panes; every
        reconnect made it worse and nothing ever repaired it, because the agent
        only ever redraws its own visible rows and never the scrollback above
        them. Omitting ``on_replay`` keeps the old single-channel behaviour, for
        internal callers that consume bytes rather than paint them.

        **This is also where a conversation is continued rather than restarted.**
        A pane holding a resume handle launches its CLI with the arguments that
        reopen that conversation; a pane without one starts fresh and keeps
        whatever handle the launch minted. Putting it here rather than in a
        dedicated "resume" path is deliberate — every way a pane can come back
        (reopening the browser, restoring a snapshot, pressing restart on a dead
        pane) already goes through this one method, so all three continue the
        conversation and none of them can drift from the others.

        A resume can fail: the CLI may have pruned that conversation, or it may
        never have had a first message. The agent then prints an error and dies
        within a second, so an early non-zero exit after a resume drops the
        handle and starts the pane fresh — once. The pane comes back empty
        instead of dead, and ``resumed`` says which of the two happened.

        ``viewer`` is the socket asking, and a pane accepts a size only from the
        viewer that is actually WATCHING it — the same identity check `detach`
        makes, for the same reason and one step further.

        **Why a size needs an owner.** A pseudo-terminal has exactly one size,
        while a pane may be open in more than one place: a second window, the
        browser UI beside the desktop app, a contributor's `--dev` tab. Those
        windows are different sizes, and this used to hand the agent whichever
        one wrote last. That alone would merely be untidy — what made it stick
        is the other half, in the pane itself: a viewer remembers the size it
        sent and stays quiet while its own measurement does not change (see
        `sentSize` in AgenticTerminal.tsx). So the moment a second viewer
        overwrote the size, the first one had no reason left to speak, and the
        agent kept formatting for a window nobody was looking at — a maximized
        pane drawing its interface into a narrow strip down the left-hand side
        (reported 2026-07-27), for as long as the pane stayed open.
        `viewer` settles it: the size comes from the viewer holding the slot,
        and a displaced one cannot move it any more than it can read from it.

        Passing nothing keeps the old unconditional behaviour, which is what an
        internal caller (a repaint nudge, a test) means by it.

        Detaching used to kill the PTY, on the reasoning that an agent nobody
        watches burns tokens invisibly. With several workspaces that reasoning
        inverts: a viewer disappears every time you switch tab, reload the page
        or walk over to the chat view, and none of those mean "stop working" —
        killing there would throw away work in progress several times an hour.

        So the lifetime rule is the one a user can actually predict: **an agent
        runs until its workspace is closed.** Nothing is invisible about it —
        every open workspace is a tab with a live-pane count on it, and closing
        one stops its agents immediately (see ``_close_locked``).

        **``viewer`` is what stops a leaving viewer from blinding the one that

        a pane or switching back to the section closes one socket and opens
        another for the SAME pane in the same breath, and which of the two the
        server finishes first is a matter of milliseconds. Clearing the slot
        unconditionally therefore wiped a viewer that had just been installed —

        transcript, and a screen that never moved again. Passing the callback

        anchor's own column and stacks the new pane under it — leaving every
        other column at full height. Without an anchor the new pane goes after
        the last one.

        The agent defaults to the anchor's, because splitting a Claude Code pane
        usually means "another one of these" — but a caller may name any
        installed agent, which is how the UI offers a choice of coding CLI.
        Without an anchor there is no "these" to copy, so the workspace's
        prevailing CLI decides instead (``_prevailing_agent``).

        ``account`` names which subscription of that agent to run on. Without
        one, every new pane opens on the workspace's active account
        (``set_active_account``) — with one exception: a pane split off an
        anchor whose seat was DELIBERATELY chosen (wizard picker, explicit
        ``account``, or itself split off such a pane) stays on that seat, so
        multiplying a second-plan pane cannot quietly move the work onto a
        different bill. An anchor that merely followed the default vouches for
        nothing, and its splits follow the switch like every other new pane.

        ``model``, ``effort`` and ``permission_mode`` are what the pane RUNS
        ON — the picks a chat surface makes before the first message. Each is
        checked against what the chosen CLI actually offers
        (:mod:`jarvis.workspace.launch_picks`) and one it cannot express is
        dropped, so a stale pick costs the CLI's own default rather than a
        pane that will not start. Unlike the account they are never inherited
        from an anchor: splitting a pane means "another one of these CLI", not
        "another one of these settings", and a model quietly carried onto a
        pane somebody opened to try something else is the confusing kind of
        helpful.

        That is precisely why rearranging is safe to offer at all. A workspace of

        Typing and hoping is not enough, which a live failure proved on
        2026-07-25: three prompts were typed into three agents and only one ran.
        The two that stalled both ended with an ``@file`` reference, and that is
        the whole mechanism — an ``@path`` (or a ``/command``) at the end of the
        line leaves the agent's completion popup OPEN, so the Enter that follows
        picks a suggestion instead of submitting. Measured on a real Claude Code:
        ending with ``@README.md`` never submits; the same prompt with one
        trailing space always does.

        So three defences, because a silent no-op is the worst outcome here:

        1. **Close any open completion** before Enter — a single space when the
           prompt ends in an ``@``/``/`` token. Harmless to the prompt text.
        2. **Verify and retry.** After Enter, the sent text must be GONE from the
           input line. While it is still sitting there, press Enter again (twice
           at most). Whether it finally went is reported back, so a caller can
           say "sent to Mika" or "Mika did not accept it" — never guess.
        3. **Fall back to one line.** A composed prompt is markdown and travels
           as a bracketed paste. Whether a given agent TUI honours that is not
           knowable from here, so a paste the pane did not accept is re-sent in
           the single-line form that has always worked. The worst case is
           therefore the old behaviour, never a lost instruction.

        ``workspace_id`` pins background work such as a deferred Continue to the
        pane it came from; without it, the front workspace keeps the established
        call-sign resolution rules.

        ``typed`` and ``attachments`` are the receipt: what the person actually
        said and the files that went with it, when ``text`` is a brief written
        around them. They are recorded beside the prompt so the chat stage can
        show the person their own sentence and their pictures, where the
        CLI's transcript holds only the brief (``prompt_receipts``).

        Raises ``SessionError`` when the terminal is unknown, not running, still
        booting after the readiness window, or the prompt sanitizes down to
        nothing. A prompt that was typed but refused to submit is NOT an error —
        the text is in the box and the caller is told.
