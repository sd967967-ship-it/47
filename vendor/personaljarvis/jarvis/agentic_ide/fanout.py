"""Deliver one spoken order to SEVERAL terminals of the open workspace.

The single-pane path (``BrainManager._run_agentic_ide_fast_path``) composes a
prompt and types it into one terminal. Doing that in a loop looks like the
obvious extension and is wrong twice over, which is why this is its own module:

**Latency.** Composing a prompt is a deliberate quality-tier call — 10-21 s
measured, chosen over a 2 s rewrite because the coding agent then works from
that prompt for minutes (maintainer decision 2026-07-25). A delegated voice
turn is abandoned after 20 s. Two panes composed one after another therefore
cannot fit in ANY turn, and eight cannot fit in a coffee break. Composition
runs concurrently here, bounded so a fleet of twenty does not fire twenty
provider calls into a rate limit at once.

**Honesty.** A loop that raises on the first dead pane leaves the earlier panes
briefed and the later ones untouched, with one exception to explain all of it.
A loop that swallows failures is worse: it produced the live 2026-07-26 lie,
where one of two agents was briefed and the user was told both were working.
So nothing here raises for a single pane's failure — every terminal comes back
with its own verdict, and the caller is expected to SAY the undelivered ones
out loud. ``FanOutResult`` deliberately has no boolean "ok": the interesting
state is the partial one, and a single flag hides it.

Cost: one composer call per pane and one PTY write per pane, all off the wake
path (AP-9). No LLM call is made here directly — the composer owns that, and
degrades to its deterministic prompt when no provider is reachable, so a
downloader with no API key still gets every agent briefed (§3).

    ``instruction`` (or the raw utterance), which is the right behaviour for
    "Iris and Bruno, both of you analyse the codebase".

    ``conversation`` is the recent turns the order came out of, passed to every
    pane's composition so a back-reference ("above all points two and three")
    can be resolved into what it names. It is the same for all of them: they
    were all addressed by the same sentence.

    ``compose`` and ``send`` are injectable so this can be tested without a live
    PTY or a provider; production leaves them at their defaults.

    ``include_pending_attachments`` belongs only to the spoken Agentic-IDE
    delivery path. Manual REST/CLI fan-out must not steal a drop that was
    explicitly staged for the next spoken prompt.

    ``on_progress`` receives the composer's ``ComposeNotice`` beats for every
    pane, so a caller that is not the REST route can put the 10-30 s of writing
    on a screen too. ``on_delivered`` is awaited with the pane's ``Terminal``
    right after its prompt went in, which is how a caller announces the ARRIVAL
    without having to wait for the slowest sibling.

    Never raises for a single pane. A pane that is missing, not running, whose
    prompt could not be written, or whose PTY write failed comes back as an
    undelivered ``Delivery`` carrying the reason.

    Survives its caller by default: cancelling this call re-raises for the
    caller but lets the briefs finish detached, because a REST client that
    disconnects has lost the ANSWER, not withdrawn the order. ``deliver`` is a
    long-running effect and a reader is not its owner.

    ``cancel_on_hangup=True`` reverses that for the spoken path: the fan-out is
    registered with :func:`cancel_spoken_deliveries` and abandoned the moment
    the call ends. Hanging up ends the order — the user stopped waiting, and a
    pane typed into half a minute later is work they no longer asked for
