"""What an Agentic-IDE user can get back after everything went away.

``Registry`` holds its workspaces in process memory, which means they last
exactly as long as the process does. This module is the thin layer that makes
that recoverable: a small JSON file naming every workspace that was open, each
pane's call-sign, which coding CLI ran in it, on which account, where it sat in
the grid, and the handle that points back at its conversation.

Same shape and the same discipline as ``recents.py``, which already proved the
pattern in this feature: one small file under the per-user data directory (never
in the repo, never in ``jarvis.toml``), atomic writes (temp file + ``os.replace``)
and defensive reads. A truncated, hand-edited or newer-version file degrades to
"there is nothing to resume" rather than breaking the view that reads it.

Two rules worth stating outright:

* **A snapshot is an offer, never a promise.** What it names may not exist any
  more — the folder can be deleted, the coding CLI uninstalled, the
  conversation pruned by the CLI itself. :func:`offer` re-checks every entry
  against the machine as it is NOW, so the user is told which panes will really
  come back *before* clicking, instead of finding out by asking a resumed agent
  a follow-up question and getting a blank stare.
* **Closing does NOT withdraw the offer.** An earlier version cleared the
  snapshot when the last workspace was closed, reasoning that re-proposing
  something somebody just shut down is noise. That was wrong, and the maintainer
  said so plainly: closing for the day and picking the same folders up tomorrow
  is the main thing this is FOR. The only thing that discards a restore point is
  the user asking for it ("Start fresh" / ``DELETE /resume``).

    question about THIS machine and not about the snapshot. The same file
    carried to a fresh install, or read after somebody uninstalled Codex, must
    say so rather than promise a pane that will fail to start.

    Two flags per pane, and they mean different things:

    * ``available`` — the pane can be opened at all (its CLI is installed).
    * ``resumable`` — its CONVERSATION comes back, not just its call-sign.

    A pane that never received a prompt, or whose CLI cannot resume, is
    ``available`` but not ``resumable``: it returns with the right name in the
    right place and an empty history. Saying so up front is the whole point.

    ``resumable`` asks the coding CLI's own history whether the conversation is
    really there, rather than trusting that a handle exists. Holding an id and
    having a conversation are different things — a pane opened and never given
    an instruction has the first and not the second — and promising twelve
    restored conversations that all turn out to be empty is exactly the lie this
    screen is meant to prevent.

    **The counts describe what resuming will actually do**, which is the LAST
    SESSION and not the whole file (see :meth:`Snapshot.last_session`). Every
    remembered workspace is still listed — a folder from Tuesday is worth
    seeing, and each carries ``in_last_session`` plus its own ``saved_at`` so
    the screen can separate "what you had open" from "also remembered" instead
    of presenting a ten-folder archive as one restart's worth of work.
