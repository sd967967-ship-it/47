"""The context block that turns focus mode into an actual coding mode.

When the user flips the Agentic IDE into focus mode, every turn should be
answered *inside* the open workspace: Jarvis should know which folder is open,
what kind of codebase it is, which skills that repo defines, which agents are
running in which pane, and what each of them last printed. Without that, "is T2
stuck?" is unanswerable and the assistant guesses — the failure mode this block
exists to prevent.

Two things live here, and the distinction matters:

* **A role directive.** Focus mode is not a hint, it is a different assistant:
  an agentic-coding partner for this one repository. It plans work with the
  user, decides which pane should do what, and hands the work over — it does not
  do the coding itself and does not start invisible background agents. Stating
  that explicitly is what stopped the live 2026-07-25 failure, where "let Kai do
  a deep dive" dispatched a background mission while Kai sat idle. The
  deterministic guards (``intent.owns_turn``, consulted by the router's
  force-spawn check and the spawn gate) are the enforcement; this text is what
  makes the model *want* the right thing in the first place, so a phrasing the
  regex misses still lands correctly.
* **The facts.** Folder, stack, branch, panes, and what each pane last printed.

Cost discipline (AP-9 / AP-26): building the block touches nothing but
in-memory state — the session's cached project profile and each terminal's ring
buffer. No disk read, no subprocess, no network. The project profile was
computed ONCE when the session started, precisely so this path stays free.

    '- When the user tells a terminal to do something ("tell T1 to …", '
    '"T2 soll …", "prompt terminal three", "let the second one '  # i18n-allow: quoted addressing example
    'refactor …"), send it to THAT terminal with '
    "the agentic-ide-prompt function. That is the whole point of this mode. "
    "NEVER spawn a background agent for work aimed at a terminal, and never "
    "answer with what you WOULD have sent — send it.\n"
    "- Hand the work over in the USER's words — everything they asked for, "
    "every constraint and file they named, nothing invented and nothing "
    "summarised away. Do not write the brief yourself: a prompt writer that "
    "has read this repository turns what you pass on into the briefed task "
    "with @path references, and a one-line headline you composed instead "
    "REPLACES that knowledge of the code with your guess at it. Passing the "
    "instruction along whole is the value you add here.\n"
    "- When the user asks what an agent is doing, read it with "
    "agentic-ide-terminal-report and answer from what that terminal actually "
    "printed. Never guess, never take a screenshot — the terminals are readable "
    "directly.\n"
    "- NEVER claim you sent, forwarded, passed on or told a terminal anything "
    'unless a function call in THIS turn actually did it. Saying "I have let '
    'T1 know" while nothing reached T1 is the worst failure this mode has: '
    "the user walks away believing an agent is working, and only finds the idle "
    "terminal later. If the work did not go out, say plainly that it did not and "
    'why — an honest "I could not reach that terminal" is always better than a '
    "confident sentence that turns out to be false.\n"
    "- A pane listed below as STILL BEING WRITTEN has received NOTHING yet. The "
    "brief is still going out (usually about a second; a slow writer is capped), "
    "and the earlier prompts counted for that pane are OLD ones, not this one. "
    "Say the work is still going out — never that it arrived, and never that "
    "the agent has started.\n"
    "- Brainstorming, architecture, and 'what should we do next' are answered "
    "inline, against this codebase, and you may propose which terminal should "
    "take which part.\n"
    '- Say the terminal\'s number out loud in your answers ("T2 is on it"), so '
