"""Does this utterance address a terminal of the open workspace?

The Agentic IDE's whole promise is that you *talk* to the agents instead of
typing at them. That only works if "tell Kai to review the wake path" reaches
Kai. Live failure 2026-07-25 (voice session 15:47): it did not — the utterance
contained the depth marker "deep dive", the router's deterministic force-spawn
heuristic recognised it as heavy work, and a background mission worker was
dispatched into a fresh git worktree while Kai's terminal sat idle. The user
saw nothing happen.

The root cause is a routing-precedence bug, not a missing feature: two
deterministic paths claimed the same turn and the older one ran first. This
module is the tie-breaker, and it is deliberately a *detector*, not a policy —
it answers one question ("which open terminal is this turn about, and does the
user want it to DO something or REPORT something?") and lets the callers decide.

Precedence, as implemented by the callers:

1. The user naming the spawn vehicle ("spawn an agent", "im Hintergrund") still
   wins — asking for a background worker *while* a workspace is open is a
   legitimate, unambiguous request, and the workspace must not swallow it.
2. Otherwise, an addressed terminal wins over force-spawn: "let Kai do a deep
   dive" means *Kai* does it, not a new invisible worker.
3. An utterance that names no terminal is none of this module's business.

Why matching is conservative: a false positive here silently withholds a
background mission the user wanted, so a bare mention of a name is not enough.
The utterance must both name a running terminal AND carry an addressing shape
(an imperative aimed at it, a "tell X to …" construction, or a question about
what it is doing). Everything is derived from the *configured* call-signs, never
from a fixed word list — a workspace whose panes are called "Bruno" and "Vega"
behaves exactly like one with the defaults.

Cost: pure regex + an in-memory registry read, no IO, no LLM (AP-9 / AP-11), so
it is safe on the voice hot path.

#    END: "kannst du Alex bitte SAGEN, dass …", "würdest du Alex BITTEN, …".
#    Every handover template above looks for the verb in front of the name, so
#    the most natural polite German assignment matched nothing.

    Closes a gap that made the phonetic tolerance half-real: ``resolve`` maps

    templates are built from ``re.escape(name)`` and therefore only ever matched
    the EXACT spelling. So "sag Elis, sie soll die Tests fixen" carried a
    textbook addressing shape, named a pane the resolver recognised — and was
    detected as nothing at all, because the one template that could have caught
    it was looking for a second "l".

    Only spellings that fold to the SAME SOUND are substituted (``fuzzy=False``).
    A merely similar word must not be rewritten into a call-sign: that is the
    branch where ordinary speech collides with the pool ("allen" scores 0.750
    against "Alex"), and rewriting it here would hand every template a name the
    user never said.

    ONE position is exempt, because there the sentence itself vouches for the
    word: whatever directly follows a briefing verb ("prompt …", "brief …",
    "beauftrage …") is being named as the addressee. Nothing else can stand
    there. So a garbled call-sign is admitted on the FUZZY band at that spot and
    at no other — which is what rescues the maintainer's own example, "hey,
    prompte adex" (2026-07-28): "adex" reaches "Alex" only fuzzily, so every
    template missed it, the last-resort branch rejected it for not being
    certain, and the turn addressed nothing at all.

    The collision risk that makes fuzzy matching dangerous elsewhere does not
    reach here: "unten"/"keine" score into the pool as ordinary sentence words,
    and an ordinary sentence word does not sit immediately behind "prompte".

    The SPOKEN POSITIONS are folded in first, by the same argument one level
    up: "prompte Terminal eins" and "prompte T1" are the same instruction, and
    rewriting the long form into the call-sign once here is what saves every
    template below from having to know that "terminal one", "tee one" and "the

    about a terminal is not the verb, it is that a running pane is called Dana
    and the sentence is a question.

    Three conditions, each removing a way of being wrong:

    1. **it is a question** — a trailing "?" or an interrogative opening it.
       A statement that merely mentions a pane is not a request for a status
       report, and the acting branches already own the ones that are;
    2. **the name is CERTAIN** — the exact call-sign or a spelling that folds
       to the same sound. Here the name is the whole case, so the fuzzy band
       is not admissible: measured against the shipping pool, ordinary speech
       reaches it ("unten" scores into "Hunter"), and an uncertain name is the
       clarify path's question to ask, not this path's answer to give;
    3. **it is not a person's full name** — "was hat Dana Schmidt gemacht" is
       about a human being, and a surname is the signal that says so.

    A question that HANDS WORK OVER is none of this branch's business, however
    it is worded. Politeness is the ordinary way to give an order out loud —
    "could you please prompt this terminal Alex, do a deep dive …?" is an
    instruction with a question mark on it — and reading it as a status request
    is how the live 2026-07-27 turn ended with an idle terminal and a spoken
    claim that the agent had been briefed. The anchored templates catch these

    """Whether the clause briefs a pane named BY POSITION, not sizes a fleet.

    The live 2026-08-12 failure this pins: "prompt … terminal tft zwei, dass
    es ein deep dive machen soll" — speech recognition mangled the call-sign
    "T2" into "tft zwei", the addressing detector found no pane, and the
    number that was the pane's NAME was then re-read here as a fleet size:
    two fresh panes opened and were briefed while the addressed one sat idle.

    Word order is what separates the two readings. A fleet size stands in
    FRONT of the pane noun ("öffne zwei Terminals"); a position stands BEHIND
    it ("Terminal zwei"), and ``spoken_positions`` is the one authority on
    that shape. So when the clause carries a briefing verb and the number the
    spawn path would read as its count — the FIRST one, which is
    ``_spoken_count``'s contract — is part of a spoken position, it is a
    brief for an existing pane, never a spawn, even when no pane answers to
    that position: falling through to the ordinary brain, which can say
    "there is no terminal two", beats opening a fleet the user never asked
    for.

    One exception keeps mixed sentences honest: a number OUTSIDE every
    position that still reads as a fleet size of its own — fronting a pane
    noun or a CLI name ("… und öffne noch drei Terminals"), or hugging an
    additive when the noun is elided ("… öffne noch drei", "open three
    more") — keeps the spawn half of such a clause alive. The additive is
    deliberately the ONLY elision evidence: open-verb stems double as task
    vocabulary ("mach einen Deep-Dive-Report" briefs, it does not open), so
    a verb near the number proves nothing. A stray task word that merely

       makes claiming it safe, and it holds with no workspace open too — the
       feature then opens one, so a background mission would be just as wrong.
    2. Otherwise an utterance that explicitly names the spawn vehicle is NOT
       owned here — asking for a background agent while a workspace happens to
       be open is a real request, and stealing it would be the mirror image of
       the bug this module fixes. That holds INSIDE coding mode too: the mode
       is not a reason to refuse a delegation the user asked for. The one
       exception is an utterance whose spawn words describe a PANE's work; see
       ``_spawn_words_describe_pane_work``.
