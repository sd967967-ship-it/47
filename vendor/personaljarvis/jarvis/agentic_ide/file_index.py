"""A bounded map of the open workspace's files, so spoken words become paths.

The point of the Agentic IDE is that you never type at the agent. But a coding
agent works far better when the prompt *points* at files — Claude Code's ``@``
reference and Codex's file mentions both pull a file into context immediately,
which is the difference between "find the wake word code" (three tool calls of
searching) and "here it is" (zero). A person speaking cannot dictate
``jarvis/plugins/wake/vosk_kws_provider.py``; they say "the Vosk wake thing".
This module closes that gap.

Design constraints that shaped it:

* **Off the hot path (AP-26 / AP-9).** The index is built once per workspace, in
  a worker thread, and cached. Nothing here runs at boot, and a voice turn never
  waits for a directory walk — if the index is not ready yet, the composer
  simply gets no file suggestions and the prompt still goes out.
* **Bounded, always.** A user can open ANY folder, including a home directory or
  a network share. The walk carries a hard file budget, a depth limit, and the
  shared skip list, so the worst case is a truncated index, never a hang.
* **Lexical, not semantic.** Matching is token overlap against path segments and
  file stems. No embedding, no model call — it must work on a machine with no
  API key at all, and a wrong suggestion costs the agent one glance.

The ranking encodes what someone actually means when they name a file out loud:
an exact stem hit beats a partial one, a hit in the file NAME beats one in a
parent directory, and tests rank below implementation unless the request is
about tests.
