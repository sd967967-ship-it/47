"""Speakable call-signs for Agentic-IDE terminals.

A pane's call-sign is its POSITION: the first terminal is ``T1``, the second
``T2``, and so on — "T" for terminal, the number for where it sits in the grid,
read left to right and top to bottom. Nothing has to be learned or remembered,
which is the whole point (maintainer directive 2026-07-28): the user looks at
the screen, sees which pane they mean, and says its number.

**Why this replaced a pool of given names.** Panes used to be called "Alex",
"Blake", "Casey" … — chosen because a phonetically distinct proper name
survives an imperfect transcript better than a spoken ordinal. That held, but
it bought robustness with two costs the position scheme simply does not have:

1. **the user had to LEARN the roster.** Addressing a pane meant first reading
   its header, then saying a name that means nothing — and getting it wrong
   sent work to a different agent;
2. **given names collide with ordinary speech.** Measured against the old pool,
   "allen" scores 0.750 against "Alex", "unten" reaches "Hunter", "keine"  <!-- i18n-allow -->
   reaches "Kai" — all above or near the acting threshold. Half of ``clarify.py`` (stop-word tables,
   capitalization heuristics, surname detection) exists to tell a spoken pane
   name apart from the sentence around it. A call-sign of the shape ``T3``
   collides with nothing in German, English or Spanish.

The cost this scheme pays instead is that a bare number IS fragile in a
transcript — so a number alone never addresses a pane. What counts is a
number carrying a TERMINAL MARKER: the letter "T" glued to it (``T3``, "tee
three"), the noun ("terminal three", "pane 3"), or an ordinal in front of the
noun ("the third terminal"). ``spoken_positions`` owns that list, and it is
deliberately the only way a position enters the system. See AP-27 for the
neighbouring doctrine — the reasoning is the same shape, but the stakes are
lower here: a mismatch costs one clarifying question, not a deaf assistant.

Custom call-signs still work. ``POST /terminals`` accepts a ``name``, so a
pane can carry any label its owner gives it, and the fuzzy/phonetic matching
below is what keeps THOSE speakable. Positional call-signs never take part in
fuzzy matching: "T1" and "T11" score 0.80 against each other, which is above
the acting floor, so a fuzzy hit between two positions would be a coin flip
over which agent gets the work. Positions match exactly or not at all.

    ``spoken`` may be a whole utterance ("what is terminal three up to?") — the
    positional forms are located inside the sentence and every word is tried
    against the custom names, so the caller does not have to pre-extract
    anything.

    Two kinds of call-sign, matched by two different rules:

    * **positional** ("T3") — EXACT only, whether written that way or spoken as
      one of the forms ``spoken_positions`` knows. Never fuzzy: "T1" and "T11"
      score 0.80 against each other, well above the acting floor, so a fuzzy
      hit between two positions would be a coin flip over which agent gets the
      work.
    * **custom** (a name the user gave the pane) — exact, or folded to the same
      sound ("Micah" → "Mika"), or merely CLOSE when ``fuzzy=True``. That last
      band is what rescues a transcript the phonetic folding does not cover,
      and it is also how ordinary speech collides with a name: measured against
      real call-signs, "unten" reaches "Hunter" and "dann" reaches "Dana". A
      caller that would ACT on the answer alone passes ``fuzzy=False``.

    The line is drawn at CERTAINTY, not at a score: a word that is the name or
    folds to the same sound ("Elis" → "Ellis") is certain and returns ``()`` —
    the acting path owns it. Everything else that still scores close is
    uncertain and belongs in a question, however high it scores.

    That boundary matters more than it looks. A merely-similar word used to sit
    in a blind spot between the two paths: "Dena" scores 0.75 against "Dana", so
    the resolver called it a match and the near-miss check stood down — while
    the addressing templates, which need the exact spelling, found nothing at
    all. The turn produced neither an action nor a question. Anchoring both
    sides on the same notion of certainty is what closes that gap.

    **Positional call-signs never produce a near miss.** "T2" is either said or
    not; the shapes that name it are explicit, and the ones that come close
    ("T1" vs "T11") are two real panes rather than one garbled word — asking
    "did you mean T11?" about a clean "T1" would invent doubt where there is
    none. A position the workspace does not have (``"T7"`` with four panes
    open) is a wrong number, not an unclear one, and the caller answers it with
    the honest "no such terminal" that names the ones that do exist.
