"""Detached helper that restarts the Jarvis desktop app cleanly.

The desktop app cannot restart itself in-process: its single-instance Named
Mutex (``Global\\PersonalJarvis_v1``) is held until the process exits, and a
fresh launcher started while the old process still lives would just activate the
old window and exit (see ``jarvis/ui/shell/single_instance.py``). So a restart is
two-phase:

1. The dying app spawns THIS detached helper (``DesktopApp.request_restart``).
2. The helper waits for the old PID to disappear (the kernel releases the mutex
   on exit), then starts a fresh launcher that claims the now-free mutex.

Invoked as::

    python -m jarvis.ui.relauncher <parent_pid> <repo_cwd>

It runs windowless + detached so it outlives its parent. Stdlib only — it must
start fast and never pull the heavy ``jarvis`` runtime into a throwaway process.
