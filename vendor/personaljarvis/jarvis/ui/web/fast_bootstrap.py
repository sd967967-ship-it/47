"""Reusable serve-first fast-boot bootstrap (the "serve first, init behind" core).

A tiny ASGI holding server that binds the admin port in a few hundred ms and
answers ``GET /api/health`` with 200 the instant it is up — so a shell that
gates on health (the desktop ``DesktopApp._wait_for_backend`` poll, or the
headless harness) sees the process as serving immediately. Every other request
is HELD until the real FastAPI app is registered via :meth:`set_app`, then
delegated to it. The first such request cleanly waits (never fails); everything
after is full speed.

Dependency-light on purpose: nothing heavy is imported at module load and
``uvicorn`` is imported lazily inside :meth:`serve`, so a caller can construct
and bind a :class:`FastBootstrap` *before* paying for ``import fastapi`` /
``load_config`` / the ``jarvis.brain`` import graph — which is exactly what
keeps those costs off the time-to-serving path.

Contract: the real app delegated to runs ON THE SAME EVENT LOOP that serves the
bootstrap. :meth:`set_app` must therefore be called from a coroutine on that
loop (the headless and desktop backends both build the app on the bootstrap's
own loop), so the readiness :class:`asyncio.Event` is set loop-locally.
