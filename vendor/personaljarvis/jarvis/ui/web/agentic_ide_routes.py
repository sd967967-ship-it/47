"""REST + WebSocket API for the Agentic IDE.

Every action of the feature is an endpoint (the CLI-first contract): the wizard,
the terminal grid, the voice commands and the ``jarvis`` CLI all drive the same
routes, so a pane's behaviour and a spoken command can never drift apart.

Endpoints (prefix ``/api/agentic-ide``):

* ``GET    /state``                      → front workspace + every open one + limits
* ``GET    /agents``                     → Claude Code / Codex install status
* ``GET    /folders``                    → browse folders (no path = start points)
* ``GET    /folders/native``             → can this machine show the OS folder window?
* ``POST   /folders/native``             → open it and return what was picked
* ``POST   /folders/create``             → make one new folder inside an existing one
* ``POST   /terminal-target/open``       → open a path printed by one terminal
* ``GET    /workspaces``                 → every open workspace, in tab order
* ``GET    /workspaces/{id}/files``      → browse that workspace's file tree
* ``GET    /workspaces/{id}/file``       → stream one workspace file in-app
* ``GET    /workspaces/{id}/file-preview`` → readable text or a binary preview
* ``PUT    /workspaces/active``          → bring one to the front (null = wizard)
* ``PATCH  /workspaces/{workspace_id}``  → rename one workspace tab
* ``DELETE /workspaces/{workspace_id}``  → close that one and stop its agents
* ``POST   /session``                    → open ANOTHER workspace (folder + terminals)
* ``DELETE /session``                    → close the front one and stop every agent
* ``GET    /resume``                     → the last workspace, offered back
* ``POST   /resume``                     → reopen it (same panes, same places)
* ``DELETE /resume``                     → forget it and start fresh
* ``GET    /interrupted``                → panes that came back and were never restarted
* ``POST   /interrupted/continue``       → tell them to carry on ("continue")
* ``PUT    /mode``                       → focused coding mode on/off
* ``GET    /ui-preferences``             → remembered terminal text size
* ``PUT    /ui-preferences``             → remember another one (survives restarts)
* ``GET    /accounts``                   → which subscription new terminals use
* ``PUT    /accounts/active``            → switch it (open panes keep theirs)
* ``POST   /terminals``                  → open one more pane (split)
* ``POST   /terminals/batch``            → open N more panes at once
* ``DELETE /terminals/agent/{agent}``    → close every pane of one coding CLI
* ``POST   /fanout``                     → run ONE task across several agents
  (open the panes, divide the work, brief each one, report who was reached)
* ``GET    /terminals/{name}/report``    → what one named terminal is doing
* ``PATCH  /terminals/{terminal}``       → give that pane another call-sign
* ``POST   /terminals/{name}/archive``   → hide or restore a chat in the session list
* ``GET    /terminals/{name}/prompts``   → every prompt handed to that pane
* ``POST   /terminals/{name}/prompt``    → type a prompt into it and press Enter
* ``POST   /terminals/{name}/attach``    → drop/paste files onto a pane
* ``GET    /voice-attachments``          → every pending orb-drop receipt
* ``GET    /terminals/{name}/voice-attachments`` → pending orb-drop receipts
* ``DELETE /terminals/{name}/voice-attachments/{batch_id}`` → cancel one drop
* ``WS     /pty/{name}``                 → the pane's live terminal stream

``{name}`` accepts the call-sign ("t2", "T2") or a spoken phrase containing it
in any of the ways a position is said ("terminal two", "the second terminal"),
so a voice command reaches the right pane without exact spelling.

    """Put dropped or pasted files in front of the agent in terminal ``name``.

    Two inputs, either or both:

    * ``paths`` — newline-separated real paths the browser DID manage to hand
      over (an Explorer/Finder drag usually carries them). Nothing is copied;
      one inside the workspace is referenced where it lies, one outside is
      copied in, because an agent's access to unrelated parts of the disk is
      neither guaranteed nor silent.
    * ``files`` — raw bytes, for everything with no path at all: a screenshot
      pasted from the clipboard, an image dragged off a web page.

    The resulting references are TYPED into the pane, not submitted, so the user
    can add a sentence before pressing Enter — which is what someone dropping a
    screenshot almost always wants to do. ``submit=true`` sends it as-is.

    Two flags change what a drop is FOR, and the prompt bar uses both:

    * ``analyze=true`` reads the files' contents — a vision-capable model
      describes an image, a document has its text extracted — and returns that
      under ``analysis``. Hand it back to ``/terminals/{name}/prompt`` as
      ``attachments`` and the composed brief carries the picture's contents,
      which is what makes dropping a screenshot work against an agent that
      cannot open one.
    * ``deliver=false`` stores and analyses without typing anything into the
      pane, for a caller that is assembling a prompt rather than handing the
      agent a path right now. The files are on disk and referenced either way,
      so nothing is lost if the user then walks away.
    * ``stage_for_voice=true`` keeps the returned analyses on this pane until
      its next spoken prompt is composed. It requires ``deliver=false`` so one
      gesture cannot both type a loose path and attach the same file to a later
      brief.
