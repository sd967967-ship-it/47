/**
 * Keeps a WebGL scene alive across the two things that kill one: running out
 * of contexts, and being told the context is gone.
 *
 * A browser allows a small, fixed number of live WebGL contexts per page —
 * Chromium's limit is 16 — and it enforces it by silently taking the OLDEST
 * one away when a new one is asked for. `WebGLRenderer.dispose()` does NOT
 * hand a context back; only `WEBGL_lose_context` does. So a page that mounts
 * and unmounts 3D scenes leaks one context per mount, and after sixteen the
 * browser kills the longest-running scene on screen — measured 2026-08-21:
 * fourteen trips into the Wiki section and back left fifteen live contexts
 * behind ONE canvas, and the deck's map (the oldest context in the page) was
 * the one that died.
 *
 * A dead canvas is not blank, either. With no `webglcontextlost` handler the
 * browser never offers the context back, and Chromium paints its own
 * broken-canvas placeholder into the element: a white rectangle with a small
 * sad face in the corner. That is the failure the maintainer screenshotted.
 *
 * So this hook does both halves:
 *  - on unmount (and between rebuilds) it RELEASES the context, so scenes that
 *    come and go do not spend the page's budget;
 *  - on a lost context it calls `preventDefault()` — without it the browser
 *    never fires `webglcontextrestored` — and rebuilds the scene by bumping a
 *    remount key, twice, before it gives up and degrades every graph on screen
 *    to the flat map with a stated reason.
