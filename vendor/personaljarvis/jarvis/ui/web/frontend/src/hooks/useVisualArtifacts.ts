/**
 * The artifacts a run left behind — the data behind the Artifacts section.
 *
 * No new REST surface: `/api/outputs` already lists the runs and
 * `/api/outputs/{slug}/artifacts` already lists their files, so this hook is a
 * read over what the run graph reads too. What it adds is the SELECTION —
 * which of those files are things a person can look at — and a flat, newest-
 * first list across runs, because "show me what came out of this" is a question
 * about pages and pictures, not about directories.
 *
 * The scan is BOUNDED (`DEFAULT_RUN_SCAN_LIMIT`). One artifact listing per run
 * is one filesystem walk on the backend, and a machine with three hundred
 * archived runs would pay for all of them on every visit to the section. The
 * limit is stated in the UI rather than hidden, so a missing older picture reads
 * as "not scanned" instead of "not there".
