/**
 * Should a canvas be rendering frames right now?
 *
 * Answered with an IntersectionObserver on the canvas host — the ONLY signal
 * this shell can be trusted on. `document.hidden` is explicitly not consulted:
 * the WebView2 host reports an on-screen window as hidden for minutes at a
 * time (docs/BUGS.md, the visibility class), so gating on it parks scenes the
 * user is looking at. `display: none` and scrolled-out-of-view both read as
 * non-intersecting, which covers section switches and hidden sticky views.
 *
 * The society README mandates this pattern for every world/card canvas.
