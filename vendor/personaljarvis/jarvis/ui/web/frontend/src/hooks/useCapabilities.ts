/**
 * useCapabilities — reports the desktop-shell capabilities the frontend needs
 * to decide *how* to perform an action.
 *
 * `native_file_actions` is true only on a local desktop run (pywebview); false
 * on a headless VPS reached through a browser. Download buttons use it to choose
 * between a backend save to the local ~/Downloads (desktop) and a normal browser
 * download (VPS/browser).
 *
 * Implemented without react-query on purpose: this is a cross-cutting capability
 * consumed by leaf components (TurnCard, ShareDialog) that are rendered — and
 * unit-tested — outside any QueryClientProvider. A module-level cache + a shared
 * in-flight promise dedupe the request so many components trigger only one fetch
 * (the same dedup react-query would give, without the provider requirement).
