/**
 * The camera work for the 3D memory maps: fill the frame, then keep turning.
 *
 * Two jobs, one owner, because they are the same state. Framing decides where
 * the middle of the network is and how far back to stand; the drift walks the
 * camera around that same point. Split across two places they fight — the
 * drift keeps restoring an angle the fit just changed.
 *
 * The motion is ONE thing: a steady clockwise turn around a fixed pivot, seen
 * from a raised camera so the turn reads as a rotation about a point rather
 * than nodes sliding sideways (maintainer decision 2026-08-18: "always
 * rotates around a fixed point, clockwise"), with a slow nod on top. It is
 * ambient, not animation: a full turn takes about a minute, and you can read
 * a label while it moves.
 *
 * And it is CONTINUOUS. Nothing in here ever sets the camera somewhere else
 * in one go once it is running: a re-frame (new data, a settled layout, the
 * Center button, a resize) only moves the target, and every frame the loop
 * eases distance and centre a little toward it. The first cut tweened the
 * camera on every re-frame and parked the drift around the tween — five
 * lurches after each data change, and a step in height on every resume.
 *
 * Three things stop it, and all three matter:
 *  - The user touching the map. Nothing is more irritating than a view that
 *    creeps away from where you just put it, so a drag or a scroll parks the
 *    drift, and when it resumes it carries on from the angle the USER left the
 *    camera at, read back out of the camera itself.
 *  - A hidden tab. Frames nobody sees still cost a GPU.
 *  - `prefers-reduced-motion`. Continuous movement is a genuine trigger for
 *    some people, and the OS switch for it is the one place they say so once
 *    instead of per app.
