/**
 * Guards the terminal grid against the font it is actually drawn with.

 * The bug these pin (browser panes, 2026-07-28): xterm measured the fallback
 * font, built a 7px cell grid from it, and then drew JetBrains Mono's 7.80px
 * glyphs into that grid — text smeared a full column out of place within nine
 * characters, and each pane told its pty ~8 columns more than it had.
 *
 * The two traps have their own tests below, because both LOOK fixed while
 * doing nothing: waiting on `document.fonts.ready` (which resolves before a
 * never-yet-rendered font is even requested) and re-fitting (which re-reads the
 * cached, wrong cell width instead of measuring again).
