 * Paint-first snapshot of the Local models overview.

 * tiles and the role checklist synchronously from it, while react-query
 * refetches in the background. The entry is versioned: a shape change bumps
 * `SNAPSHOT_VERSION` and older entries are simply ignored. Entries above
 * ~200 KB are not written (a huge inventory would otherwise crowd the
 * origin's storage quota out for the other caches).
 *
 * The payload type is imported from the hook module as a type only — this
 * file stays free of React and react-query so the idle prefetch can read it.
