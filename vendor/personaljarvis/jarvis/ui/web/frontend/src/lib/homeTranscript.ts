/**
 * The live transcript the voice stage shows: what was said to the assistant,
 * what it did on the way, and what it answered — as lines, newest last.
 *
 * Why its own reducer and not `messages`: a SPOKEN turn does not travel as
 * `MessageSent`. The pipeline publishes the heard words as `TranscriptFinal`
 * (and the last `TranscriptionUpdate` with `is_final`), and the answer as
 * `SpeechSpoken` — the authoritative "this was actually said out loud" track,
 * usually in sentence-sized pieces. Typed turns DO come as `MessageSent`.
 * The lane merges the two so it reads the same whether you spoke or typed.
 *
 * Steps (2026-08-23): the event store collects reasoning steps only for TYPED
 * turns (`chatThinking`), so a spoken "search my mail" showed the answer and
 * nothing of the tool call that produced it. Here every turn carries its own
 * steps as a third line kind, `who: "steps"`, sitting between the user's
 * words and the answer. The step model itself is `lib/thinkingSteps.ts` —
 * the same reducer the chat uses, so both stages read the same events the
 * same way; this module only decides WHICH turn an event belongs to and when
 * a turn is over.
 *
 * Turn boundaries, in order of evidence:
 *   - open on `BrainTurnStarted` or on the first tool / worker / computer-use
 *     event (the classic pipeline publishes BrainTurnStarted+Completed
 *     together AFTER the tools ran, so a tool event is often the first sign);
 *   - close on `BrainTurnCompleted`, `VoiceTurnCompleted`, a turn-ending
 *     `SpeechSpoken` (a reply, not a preamble or progress nudge), the next
 *     user utterance, the session going idle or back to listening after
 *     speech, or staleness — a turn with no event for STALE_TURN_MS is over
 *     whatever the backend forgot to say.
 * Steps that arrive shortly after a close (a late ActionExecuted, the
 * pipeline's BrainTurnStarted after its tools) still join that turn.
 *
 * Pure: (lines, event) → lines, and the same array back for every event it
 * does not read, so the store can skip the update.
