/**
 * Notice that the frontend on disk is newer than the one this window is
 * running, and pick it up without anyone restarting anything.
 *
 * The desktop window has no reload key and no dev tools, so for a long time the
 * only way to see a rebuilt frontend was the in-app Restart button — which
 * stops and starts the whole application, voice stack and agent panes included,
 * to replace files the browser would have fetched on its own. `index.html` is
 * served `no-store` and every asset carries a content hash, so a plain reload
 * has always been enough. This module is the missing trigger.
 *
 * It complements ./preloadRecovery rather than replacing it: that one heals a
 * window that has ALREADY crashed on a chunk deleted by a rebuild, which only
 * happens when the user navigates into a view that was not loaded yet. A window
 * sitting on an open view never asks for a missing chunk and stays stale
 * forever. This one asks the server what a fresh window would load.
 *
 * Two rules keep it from being worse than the problem:
 *
 * * a change must survive two consecutive polls, because a build in progress
 *   publishes an `index.html` whose chunks are not all written yet, and
 *   reloading into that is the flicker loop preloadRecovery was written for;
 * * the user must be idle for a moment, because a reload in the middle of a
 *   sentence loses the sentence.
 *
 * And two rules keep it from quietly dying, which is the failure that was
 * actually reported (2026-08-23: the desktop window ran a morning-old build
 * through two rebuilds and showed every section it had not visited yet as a
 * crash):
 *
 * * a window that says it is hidden is still checked, only slower. The
 *   desktop shell's engine (WebView2 under pywebview) was measured reporting
 *   an on-screen, on-top window as `visibilityState === "hidden"` for minutes
 *   at a time; a watch that trusts that verdict never polls again. One request
 *   every half minute is nothing, and a reload of a window nobody is looking at
 *   costs nothing either;
 * * a check that never answers does not hold the watch. The single in-flight
 *   guard protected against stacking, but a request the engine never settles —
 *   a server mid-restart, a socket the machine slept through — turned it into
 *   a permanent lock. An answer that is late past a few ticks is treated as
 *   lost and a fresh check goes out.
