/**
 * The deck's opening — the boot sequence and the moment the board takes over.
 *
 * Before the first turn the mission deck used to show the full board: nine
 * instruments, most of them saying "nothing yet". The maintainer's verdict
 * (2026-08-18): boring, and worse at the very start, when the app is still
 * coming up. So the deck opens on a start sequence and launches into the
 * board — TWO phases, forward only:
 *
 *   boot   — the app is coming up. The stage shows the four gates a voice
 *            turn needs (link, voice, brain, wake), each lighting up the
 *            moment it is really true, with the time it took.
 *   board  — the mission control board. Reached the moment a turn opens (a
 *            wake word, a hotkey, a typed message, a press on the orb), when
 *            the person opens it by hand — and otherwise ON ITS OWN, the
 *            beat after the gates are up (`autoLaunchAfterMs`). Then it
 *            STAYS: the phases only ever move forward within a session,
 *            because a stage that flips back and forth is a stage nobody can
 *            read.
 *
 * There used to be a third phase between them — a standby ring that waited
 * for somebody to say the wake word. The maintainer had it cut on
 * 2026-08-20: opening the app must land you on the board, not on a screen
 * that asks you to speak first. The launch it used to play is now the boot's
 * own ending, so nothing about the choreography was lost — only the waiting.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented: every gate is a store field the header lamps
 * already show, and the durations are measured on this very screen. Pure
 * module — no React, no timers — so deckStandby.test.ts can pin all of it.
