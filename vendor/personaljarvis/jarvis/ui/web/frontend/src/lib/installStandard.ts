/**
 * The marketplace install commands — the lines that add a listing.
 *
 * Both stores show the same lines: this file inside the app, and the website's
 * the community registry's own README. A visitor who reads a
 * command on the storefront and a user who reads it in the Plugins view have
 * to see the same string, or one of the two is advertising a command that does
 * not work. `installStandard.test.ts` pins the exact output, so a rename on
 * either side fails a test instead of going live unnoticed.
 *
 * TWO standards, not one:
 *
 *  - **Personal Jarvis** — `jarvis marketplace install <name>` installs into
 *    this app. Available for every listing, because the registry is ours.
 *  - **skills.sh** — `npx skills add <owner>/<repo>` is the open agent-skills
 *    installer (Vercel Labs; see https://skills.sh). It reads a `SKILL.md`
 *    straight out of a GitHub repository and drops it into whichever agent is
 *    configured locally: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, and the rest.
 *    Offered for SKILLS only — a plugin carries an MCP server and a connect
 *    flow, which that installer knows nothing about.
 *
 * The skills.sh line is derived, never stored: a published entry already
 * carries the two URLs it needs (`raw_url`, `source_url`). The derivation is
 * exact when `raw_url` points at the file (the folder holding `SKILL.md` IS
 * the `--skill` argument, and a `SKILL.md` at the repository root means no
 * `--skill` at all). With only a repository URL the entry name is used, which
 * is what the registry publishes as `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
 *
 * The commands themselves are identical on every operating system. Only the
 * shell prompt drawn in front of them differs, which is what `shellPrompt`
 * answers.
