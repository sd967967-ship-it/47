/**
 * The wallpapers that ship INSIDE the app — the one place that knows them.
 *
 * Everything else in the wallpaper section comes from somewhere optional: the
 * generated library is a git-ignored download, the uploads live in the data
 * directory, the marketplace needs a network. These few are part of the
 * program, so a fresh checkout, a headless container, and a machine that never
 * downloaded anything all have them — and every consumer that holds only an id
 * (the shell painting the ground, a pick restored from storage, a grid tile)
 * resolves it here first, before asking `/api/wallpapers`.
 *
 * Two kinds live in this list:
 *
 * - The two ORIGINALS, one per mode. Each is the default and the fallback of
 *   its mode: an empty selection means "this one" (see store/wallpaper.ts and
 *   useDesktopWallpaper), and adopting it is the same act as clearing the
 *   choice.
 * - The PLAIN grounds — pure black for dark, pure white for light. Ordinary
 *   wallpapers in every respect (stored by id, starred, filtered), just with
 *   no pixels to fetch: a solid colour is drawn, not downloaded, so each is a
 *   tiny SVG data URI instead of an asset file.
 *
 * Every entry is authored for exactly one mode, like every other wallpaper —
 * adopting one switches the interface into that mode.
