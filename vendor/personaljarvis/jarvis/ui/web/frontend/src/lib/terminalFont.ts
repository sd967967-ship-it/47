/**
 * Keep xterm's cell grid in step with the font it actually draws with.
 *
 * A terminal is a grid: xterm measures ONE glyph, calls that the cell width,
 * and lays out every column from it. Measure it before the display font has
 * loaded and the whole grid is built on the fallback's metrics — at 13px,
 * Consolas advances 7.15px where JetBrains Mono advances 7.80px, a 9% error.
 * Every glyph is then painted 0.65px wider than the cell it owns, so nine
 * characters in, the text sits a full column off its grid. That is the smeared,
 * overlapping terminal output reported in the browser on 2026-07-28: measured
 * live in Chrome, all six panes had a 7px cell while JetBrains Mono was loaded
 * and drawing at 7.80px, and each pane had told its pty ~102 columns where only
 * ~94 fit.
 *
 * Two things make this easy to get wrong, and both were:
 *
 * * **`document.fonts.ready` does not mean "the terminal font is here."** It
 *   resolves once nothing is PENDING, and a font no element has rendered yet
 *   was never requested, so it is not pending. Measured in Chrome on the live
 *   app: `document.fonts.status === "loaded"` while
 *   `document.fonts.check('400 13px "JetBrains Mono"') === false`. Waiting on
 *   it therefore re-fits at a moment that proves nothing — and, worse, retires
 *   the one chance to fix the grid. The font has to be asked for BY NAME.
 * * **A re-fit does not re-measure.** xterm re-measures only when `fontFamily`
 *   or `fontSize` CHANGE (`CharSizeService` subscribes to exactly those two),
 *   and its options setter ignores a write of the identical string. `fit()`
 *   reads the cached, wrong cell width and faithfully recomputes the same wrong
 *   grid, so clearing the texture atlas and re-fitting cannot repair this on
 *   its own.
 *
 * Hence: ask for the font by name, then WATCH — the only signal that cannot lie
 * is the measurement itself, so a font that arrives late (slow CDN, an @import
 * whose stylesheet had not been parsed when it was first asked for) is still
 * caught. Offline, where the font never arrives, the fallback IS the font being
 * drawn, the measurement never changes, and nothing happens.
