/**
 * Where a finished dictation goes when Jarvis itself is the window in front.
 *
 * ## Why this file has to exist
 *
 * Dictation into a FOREIGN application works by putting the transcript on the
 * clipboard and sending a paste chord. Into Jarvis's own window that route is
 * deliberately not taken: `jarvis/dictation/insert.py::resolve_target` sees its
 * own process in the foreground and switches the target to the in-app channel
 * instead of typing into itself.
 *
 * That channel then had exactly one consumer — the chat composer, which only
 * exists while the Chats section is on screen. So a dictation into an IDE
 * terminal pane, a settings field or a setup step was transcribed, polished,
 * published… and delivered to a component that was not mounted. The words
 * reached nothing but the dictation history, with no error anywhere (measured
 * 2026-07-29: 18 of 139 stored dictations carry outcome `chat` and no insertion
 * method).
 *
 * This module is the missing consumer. It delivers inside the page rather than
 * through synthetic keystrokes, which is what makes it work identically on
 * Windows, macOS and Linux: no clipboard, no paste chord, nothing the operating
 * system can block, and no race against the clipboard being restored.
 *
 * ## How the target is chosen
 *
 * First, the document itself must still be visible and focused. WebSocket
 * events are broadcast to every connected UI client; without that ownership
 * check, an old tab or a second desktop window can paste the same transcript
 * into its own remembered field. Within the one owning document, the target is
 * the element that has focus when the transcript arrives, and — as a fallback —
 * the last editable one that had it. That fallback is allowed only while an
 * explicitly marked dictation control has focus. An unrelated toolbar or pane
 * click must invalidate the old field as a destination; otherwise "current
 * field" quietly becomes "whatever field was used earlier." A real dictation
 * button still moves focus onto itself, and "insert where the caret was" remains
 * available for that deliberate case.
 *
 * A remembered element that has since left the DOM is skipped, so switching
 * sections cannot deliver into a field that is no longer on screen.
 *
 * Terminal panes are not text: they paint onto a canvas and read their keyboard
 * through a hidden textarea, so writing into that textarea would do nothing.
 * They register a bridge (`editActions.ts::attachTerminalBridge`) and are
 * pasted through xterm, which brackets the sequence the way a coding agent's
 * TUI expects. That registry already existed for the right-click menu; this
 * module reuses it rather than growing a second one that could drift from it.
 */

 * What became of one transcript.

 * `inactive` means another visible, focused UI client owns this broadcast, so

 * composer. `none` is the honest answer when the owning document has nowhere
 * to put the text. The caller says so — see `useWebSocket`.
