/**
 * Recover from a lazy chunk that is no longer on disk — exactly once.
 *
 * When the frontend is rebuilt while the desktop window is open, the running
 * main bundle still asks for lazy chunks by their previous content hash. Those
 * URLs are gone, the dynamic `import()` rejects, and whichever view tried to
 * load hard-crashes. Vite announces precisely this case as `vite:preloadError`,
 * and reloading once picks up the fresh bundle — `index.html` is served
 * `no-store`, so a reload really does get the new hashes.
 *
 * The danger is the other half: a rebuild is not instantaneous. While
 * `npm run build` runs, `dist/` passes through a state where the old chunks are
 * already deleted and the new ones are not written yet, so a reload lands on
 * the same missing chunk and asks for another reload. That is a loop measured
 * on 2026-07-28 18:51 — the window cycled through "Checking access…", the
 * boot shell and a brief "Ready for commands" several times within about three
 * seconds, which is what a user sees as a violently flickering app that never
 * finishes starting.
 *
 * A guard existed for that loop and could not work: it was cleared on the
 * window's `load` event, which fires when the document and its static
 * resources are done — always BEFORE a lazy chunk is imported, and therefore
 * always before the error it was meant to bound. Every pass through the loop
 * found the guard freshly cleared.
 *
 * So the release is tied to evidence instead of to `load`: the guard is lifted
 * only once the app has run {@link SETTLE_MS} without a preload error, which
 * means this page is healthy and a LATER rebuild may heal itself the same way.
 * A second failure inside that window is the loop, and it stops there — the
 * failed import surfaces through the view's error boundary, which is a
 * readable card instead of a flicker.
