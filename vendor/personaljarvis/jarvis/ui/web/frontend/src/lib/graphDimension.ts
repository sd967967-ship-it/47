/**
 * Flat map or space: which dimension the memory maps are drawn in.
 *
 * Both graph surfaces — the vault Memory Map in the normal Wiki and the topic
 * map — read this one preference, so the choice follows
 * the user around instead of having to be made twice. It is a view preference,
 * not knowledge: it lives in localStorage next to the other per-machine view
 * settings (`jarvis.agenticIde.workspaceView`, `jarvis.ui.sound`) rather than
 * in `jarvis.toml`, because a monitor that can render a 3D scene is a property
 * of the machine in front of the user, not of the install.
 *
 * The WebGL probe is the honest half of the feature. 3D needs a hardware
 * (or software-emulated) graphics context, and there are real machines that
 * cannot give one: a locked-down WebView, a VM with no GPU passthrough, a
 * remote desktop session. Offering a button that silently paints nothing there
 * would be worse than not offering it, so the probe decides whether the switch
 * is live and the UI says why when it is not.
 *
 * Pure + framework-free apart from the tiny store at the bottom, so the
 * parsing and fallback rules are unit-testable without a renderer.
