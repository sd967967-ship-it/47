// When the frontend is rebuilt while the window is open, the old main bundle
// still references lazy chunks by their previous content hash; those URLs now
// 404 and the dynamic import() rejects, hard-crashing whichever view tried to
// load (e.g. the Wiki page's ObsidianButton). Vite fires `vite:preloadError`
// for exactly this case — reload once to pick up the fresh bundle, and only
// once per incident, because a rebuild in progress hands the reload the same
// missing chunk and the window ends up cycling. See lib/preloadRecovery.

// asks for a deleted chunk, so it never notices a rebuild at all and shows an
// old UI until someone restarts the whole application. Ask the server what a
// fresh window would load, and reload when the answer has changed — a rebuild
// is then something the user watches happen instead of something they operate.
// See lib/bundleWatch for the two guards that keep this quiet.
