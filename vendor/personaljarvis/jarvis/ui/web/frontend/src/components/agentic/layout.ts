/**
 * How N agent panes are laid out in the workspace — the ONE answer, shared by
 * the grid that renders them and the wizard that previews them.
 *
 * It used to be two answers. The grid put every pane of a row side by side
 * (the backend starts a session with all panes in row 0), while the wizard's
 * dot preview had its own formula that stacked them 3-per-line — so picking
 * "4 terminals" showed 3 above and 1 below and then opened 4 side by side. A
 * preview that contradicts the thing it previews is worse than no preview, and
 * the only durable fix is that both call the same function.
 *
 * ## The workspace is COLUMNS of stacked panes
 *
 * A workspace is a left-to-right list of columns, and each column is a
 * top-to-bottom stack of one or more panes. "Split right" opens a new column
 * beside the anchor; "split down" adds a pane to the anchor's OWN column and
 * leaves every other column untouched.
 *
 * That is the whole point of the model. The earlier one had a single axis — a
 * pane knew only its row — so "split down" could only mean "open a new row",
 * and a row spans the whole window by definition. Splitting one pane therefore
 * squashed all the others to half height, which is not what splitting a pane
 * means anywhere else. A second axis is the smallest thing that fixes it.
 *
 * ## Why one grid and not nested containers
 *
 * The obvious rendering — a flex row of column elements, each a flex column of
 * panes — is wrong here, and expensively so. Every pane must stay MOUNTED for
 * its whole life: unmounting one tears down its WebSocket and kills the coding
 * agent behind it. React re-parents children when the element tree changes
 * shape, so closing a column would remount the panes of every column after it.
 *
 * `paneGrid` therefore returns COORDINATES, not nested lists. All panes are
 * siblings inside one grid container that never changes, and a layout change is
 * only ever a change of numbers on each pane. Nothing is re-parented, so
 * nothing remounts.
 *
 * ## However many columns there are — and ALWAYS one screenful
 *
 * The workspace never wraps. Opening a column always puts it beside the last
 * one, and a workspace of twenty columns is twenty columns across. Nothing here
 * refuses a count or rearranges one behind the user's back: thirty columns on a
 * laptop is a thing they may build, and on a wall display it is a reasonable
 * thing to want. The only shape this module decides is the one a workspace
 * OPENS in (see `wizardPanes`), and every later split, drag and close is the
 * user's.
 *
 * It also never scrolls. The whole workspace is exactly the area it is given:
 * open a pane and every pane gets a little smaller, on whichever axis the split
 * was. That is the maintainer's standing rule for this screen (2026-08-04), and
 * it settles the two failures that came before it:
 *
 * * **Wrapping** (until 2026-08-03) paid for a new pane with the HEIGHT of every
 *   existing one, so the sixth split silently halved the five panes the user was
 *   already reading and dropped the new one onto a second line. The arrangement
 *   changed SHAPE because of a pane added at the end.
 * * **Scrolling** (its replacement) kept the shape and moved the panes off the
 *   screen instead — a seventh terminal was opened somewhere to the right, and
 *   watching eight agents meant scrolling between them. A wall of terminals you
 *   have to scroll is not a wall of terminals.
 *
 * So neither axis has a floor that grows the canvas any more. Readability is a
 * thing the user manages themselves, with the two controls that already exist:
 * open fewer panes, or maximize the one being read. `COMFORTABLE_PANE_WIDTH_PX`
 * survives ONLY as the number the wizard's readout warns from — advice before
 * anything opens, never a layout decision.

 * 13 px monospace a character is ~7.8 px wide, so 45 characters plus the pane's
 * frame and padding lands near 380 px. Measured against a real agent on
 * 2026-07-25 — at ~18 characters Claude Code truncates every line and breaks
 * single words across rows ("Clau/de/Max").
 *
 * Nothing lays out by it. The workspace is always one screenful (see the header
 * above), so this number's only job is to let the wizard say "twelve panes on
 * this window is about 130 px each, which is tight" BEFORE the user commits to
