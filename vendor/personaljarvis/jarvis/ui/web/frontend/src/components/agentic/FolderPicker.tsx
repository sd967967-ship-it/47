/**
 * Which folder the agents work in.
 *
 * Six ways to arrive at one, because people arrive differently:
 *
 * 1. **The system folder window** — Explorer on Windows, Finder on macOS, the
 *    desktop's own dialog on Linux. The one people already know. Offered only
 *    when the backend confirms this machine can actually show it (see below).
 * 2. **Recents** — the folders opened before, with their previous layout. One
 *    click and the launcher already knows how many terminals to open.
 * 3. **Search** — type a name, get matches from anywhere under home and the
 *    usual code directories. Faster than clicking down five levels. The same
 *    field reads a PATH as a place, not a name: `C:\Users\me\.claude` opens
 *    that folder on the spot instead of searching the disk for a folder called
 *    that (which found nothing, and was reported as "search is broken").
 * 4. **Browsing** — the list, projects and repositories sorted first. Hidden
 *    folders (`.claude`, `.config`) stay out of the way until asked for.
 * 5. **Typing a path** — with completion, the way `cd` works in a terminal.
 * 6. **Drag and drop** — drop a folder (or a file inside it) anywhere on the
 *    panel. Inside the desktop shell the host reports the real path
 *    (`waitForNativeDrop`); in a browser only the NAME is known, and the
 *    backend searches for it — see `extractDropPayload`.
 * 7. **A new folder** — a project that does not exist yet has nothing to pick.
 *    "New folder" makes one inside the folder on screen, and a typed path that
 *    is not a folder yet is offered for creation rather than only refused.
 *
 * The in-page browser is not a fallback for the system window, it is the floor:
 * the system window opens on the machine the BACKEND runs on, so it is useless
 * over a network and absent on a headless server. Everything here therefore
 * works without it, and the button appears only where it can deliver.
 *
 * ## Six ways, one list
 *
 * Those six used to be six regions stacked down a column — a grid of recent
 * cards, a search row, a breadcrumb, the listing, a drop result, a path field,
 * and a bar repeating what was selected — each with its own border and its own
 * heading. Every one of them answers the same question, so a reader had to scan
 * seven bordered boxes to find the one route they wanted.
 *
 * Now there is one scrolling list. Recents are a labelled group at the top of
 * it, not a separate control with a different shape; search filters that same
 * list in place; the path field sits under it as a single line. What is above
 * the list is only ever navigation, what is below it is only ever typing, and
 * the folder that is chosen is reported once — in the launcher's header, where
 * the button that acts on it is.
 *
 * The start view is labelled with the machine's own name rather than the account
 * folder: "Administrator" says nothing about which computer you are looking at,
 * "Ruben's MacBook" does.
