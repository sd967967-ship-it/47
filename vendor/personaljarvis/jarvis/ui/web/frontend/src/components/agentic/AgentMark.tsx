/**
 * What ground a brand file needs in order to be legible.
 *
 * Every mark that ships with the app was drawn for the dark product this
 * started as, and they are not all broken in the same way on paper — so one
 * blanket treatment cannot fix them (maintainer, 2026-08-11: a light-mode
 * restore screen showed seven terminals with no sign of which CLI each was
 * running).
 *
 * * `ink` — a single-colour silhouette; the file is one `fill="#F4F4F5"` and
 *   nothing about that colour is brand. It is drawn as a MASK over the current
 *   text ink, so it follows the theme by itself: the same near-white on the
 *   dark app, near-black on paper, from one asset and with no theme prop
 *   threaded through the tree.
 * * `dark` — a full-colour lockup whose own background is white or near-white
 *   (OpenCode's outer square; the body of the Kimi glyph). On paper those
 *   shapes ARE the paper, and the mark collapses to whichever fragment happens
 *   to be dark — OpenCode became an unlabelled grey dot. These keep their
 *   colours and get a constant dark canvas: the ground they were drawn on.
 * * `any` — a lockup that already carries its own ground (Z.ai is a dark tile
 *   with a white glyph) and reads on either theme untouched.
