/**
 * How many terminals the workspace opens with, and the shape they land in.
 *
 * ## One control, three grips
 *
 * The count used to be four separate controls sitting one under the other: a
 * number field with its own minus and plus, a slider, and a row of seven preset
 * buttons. All four set the same integer, so all four had to show the same
 * "selected" state, and a screen that says one thing four times in four visual
 * languages is what makes an interface feel machine-assembled.
 *
 * It is now ONE control that happens to be reachable three ways — a stepper you
 * read the number off, a track you drag, and tick labels under that track. The
 * ticks are not presets and are not styled as buttons: they are the scale's
 * legend, and clicking a legend entry is a convenience, not a second mechanism.
 * Every value between them is still reachable, which is the whole reason a
 * "custom" row never needed to exist.
 *
 * ## The stage shows the workspace, not a picture of agents working
 *
 * Each miniature pane used to draw three animated bars standing in for the
 * agent's output. It looked alive and said nothing — no agent has started, and
 * the bars' widths came from an array indexed by pane number. Invented content
 * is the cheapest way to make a preview feel untrustworthy, because the moment
 * the reader works out the bars are fake they stop believing the arrangement
 * too. So the panes now show exactly what is knowable before the workspace
 * opens: how many there are, where each one sits, what each one is called, and
 * which one the prompt bar will type into.
 *
 * The arrangement itself is not decorative. `paneGrid` is the same function the
 * running workspace lays itself out with, fed the same panes the backend will
 * create, at the measured width the grid will occupy — so the preview cannot
 * describe a workspace that will not appear.

 *
 * * The caret only appeared if you hit the 48 px the digits occupied. The

 *   segment focuses the field, and it carries a text cursor and a hover tint so
 *   the pointer says "editable" before the click.
 * * `type="number"` looks like a display because a browser draws it like one.
 *   It also behaves differently in Chromium, WebKit and the desktop WebView,
 *   reports an empty string for anything it privately considers invalid, and
 *   adds spin buttons that then have to be hidden again. A text field with
 *   `inputMode="numeric"` keeps the phone keypad, hands us the raw keystrokes,
 *   and behaves identically everywhere — at the price of stepping with the

 * What the stage shows, in words, together with what it costs.

 * about the thing the user would notice a minute later.
 *
 * ## Why it counts COLUMNS and not only pixels
 *
 * "About 145 px each" is true and says nothing. A pixel width means one thing
 * at 8 px text and the opposite at 20, and the number that says how much room
 * an agent's output really gets is the column count — below
 * {@link WORKABLE_COLS} the readout says so, and that sentence is the whole
 * consequence: the panes open as terminals at that width regardless (the card
 * that used to hide them was retired on 2026-08-18).
 *
 * That is exactly what went unsaid on 2026-08-13: twelve terminals opened on a
 * 1 920 px window at text size 20 with no warning at all, because the only
 * question asked was "twenty or more?" — a fixed count, blind to both the
 * window and the text size. The readout now measures the real font and says
 * what the user is about to get, in the unit that decides it.
