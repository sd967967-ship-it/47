/**
 * Terminal colour schemes for the Agentic IDE.
 *
 * ## Why this file holds literal colours when nothing else may
 *
 * The design system forbids a literal colour anywhere in the product; every
 * surface names a token. This module is its one sanctioned exception, for two
 * reasons that cannot be designed away. xterm's `ITheme` takes resolved colour
 * strings — it cannot read `hsl(var(--card))`, and the minimum-contrast maths
 * below needs real numbers to compute a ratio from. And a pane's appearance is
 * a SEPARATE setting from the app theme: a light pane inside a dark app is a
 * supported combination, so a pane that read app tokens would paint its chrome
 * for the wrong ground exactly when the two disagree.
 *
 * So the rule holds in a different shape: the 16 ANSI slots are the terminal's
 * own palette (one of the few places hue legitimately survives), and everything
 * else in this file — `PANE_CHROME`, `PANE_BRAND` — is the app's surface and
 * ink ladder re-derived for each appearance. No value here is invented; each
 * one names the step it stands for in its comment.
 *
 * Why a hand-built light palette instead of "same colours, white background":
 * the 16 ANSI colours a coding agent emits were designed for dark terminals.
 * Their bright variants (yellow, cyan, white) have almost no contrast on paper,
 * and `brightBlack` — which agents use for hints, diffs, and dimmed prose —
 * becomes invisible. So the light theme re-derives all 16 slots for a light
 * ground: darker, more saturated hues, with the "bright" row kept genuinely
 * distinguishable rather than lighter.
 *
 * The xterm canvas itself stays transparent. The stable reading ground comes
 * from the translucent pane shell below it, so the desktop artwork remains
 * visible without stacking two dark fills into an effectively opaque panel.
 * A TUI that still paints its own `bg_base` on every cell (Grok Build's
 * fullscreen themes do) is cleared on the way into xterm — see
 * ./terminalGlass — so that fill becomes the same default background Claude
 * Code already leaves alone.
 *
 * ## Why a palette alone cannot make every pane readable
 *
 * The 16 slots below only catch CLIs that speak classic ANSI. A modern coding
 * agent draws most of its UI in 24-bit truecolor — exact RGB values chosen for
 * the theme IT is configured for — and those bytes bypass this palette
 * entirely. A CLI set to its dark theme paints near-white text into a light
 * pane, and no slot remap can intercept that. `MINIMUM_CONTRAST_RATIO` is the
 * floor under that hole: xterm nudges ANY foreground (truecolor included)
 * toward black or white until it reaches the ratio against the background.
 * For that computation to run against the pane's REAL ground, each theme's
 * transparent `background` carries the shell's RGB at alpha 0 — invisible on
 * screen, but the number the contrast maths reads.
 */

/**
 * WCAG AA for body text, and the same default VS Code ships for its
 * integrated terminal. High enough that dark-theme truecolor becomes readable
 * on a light pane, low enough that a CLI's deliberate dim/bright hierarchy
 * survives.

 * Every value below is one of the app's own surface-ladder steps, expressed as
 * an alpha over the pane's ground so it still composites correctly when a
 * wallpaper is showing through the shell. On a flat ground they resolve to the
 * tokens by name: `border` lands on `--border`, `edge.exited` a step below it,
 * `PaneBrand.chip` on `--secondary`, `PaneBrand.accentSoft` on
 * `--border-strong`. The table exists because a pane's appearance is a
 * SEPARATE setting from the app theme — a light pane inside a dark app is a
 * supported combination — so the pane resolves the ladder against its own
 * ground rather than reading `hsl(var(--…))`, which would be the app's.
 *
 * ## Why the edge is a state and not a decoration
 *
 * A wall of twelve panes has one thing every reader is looking for: which of
 * them still needs them. The activity pill answers that per pane, but a pill is
 * something you READ — you have to land on the pane first. The edge is what the
 * eye can sweep, so it carries exactly one distinction and carries it quietly:
 *
 * * `connecting` / `live` — the resting edge. The overwhelming majority of
 *   panes are here, and a workspace where everything is marked marks nothing.
 * * `exited` — dimmer than resting. The agent is gone; the pane recedes rather
 *   than shouting, because a finished terminal is not a problem.
 * * `error` — the fault hue, at an alpha that reads across a room without
 *   turning the pane into an alert box.
 *
 * The red used to be the matching terminal theme's own `red` slot. It is now
 * the app's fault hue re-derived per appearance — the same `#E8574C` the dark
 * theme paints `--destructive` with, and the darker `#C72E23` light mode uses —
 * because "this pane failed" is one status across the whole product and must
 * not change hue with a per-pane preference. Re-deriving it here rather than
 * reading the token keeps the ground correct when the two settings disagree.

 *
 * The values are the app's ink scale, not a second palette: `ink` is the body
 * step, `inkMuted` the meta step, `inkFaint` the placeholder step, and `accent`
 * is the fill — white on a dark pane, warm near-black on a light one. It used
 * to be a signal-yellow "brand" accent in two voices; the brand hue was retired
 * (Ink & Paper), and a title bar is chrome rather than a place to spend colour.
 * Hue now survives on a pane only where it means something: the terminal's own
