/**
 * The draggable seam between two panes — the one grip the whole app uses.
 *
 * It exists once because a splitter is mostly a set of small decisions that
 * must not differ from screen to screen: how wide the hit target is, what the
 * cursor turns into, whether a double-click resets, and whether the keyboard
 * can move it at all. Two hand-rolled copies drift within a week.
 *
 * Two details are worth knowing:
 *
 * * **The seam you see is 1px; the seam you can hit is 6px.** A one-pixel
 *   target is a coordination test, not a control — so the visible line is thin
 *   and the transparent grab area around it is six times wider.
 * * **It is reachable without a mouse.** `role="separator"` plus a tab stop and
 *   the arrow keys mean the layout can be adjusted from the keyboard, which is
 *   also the only way to recover a pane that was dragged shut on a touchpad.
