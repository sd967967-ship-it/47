/**
 * The pane header's headline — what this session is doing — and the card behind
 * it.
 *
 * ## What was wrong with the version this replaces
 *
 * The header line itself was never the problem: a header is a few centimetres
 * wide, a recap is a sentence, and CSS clipping it is correct. The problem was
 * everything around that:
 *
 * * **The long form was unreadable.** It lived in a CSS-only hover tooltip
 *   anchored inside the pane, capped at the pane's own width. On a quarter of a
 *   screen that is a column of 11 px text a dozen characters wide — the text
 *   was all there and none of it could be read.
 * * **It could not be touched.** `pointer-events-none` meant the moment you
 *   moved the mouse toward it, it vanished. Nothing in it could be selected,
 *   copied, or clicked.
 * * **A thin recap never explained itself.** The backend has always known
 *   whether a model wrote the line or the string rules did, and why not the
 *   model — that never reached the screen, so "the recaps are not meaningful"
 *   had no visible cause.
 * * **It could not be corrected.** No summarizer knows that a pane is "the
 *   branch I'm about to demo" or "leave this one alone".
 *
 * So the long form is a real card now: rendered in a portal so the pane's own
 * `overflow: hidden` cannot clip it, wide enough to read a paragraph in, given
 * the app's card surface rather than a bespoke one, and interactive — it says
 * who wrote the recap and when, it can be refreshed, and a labelled action lets
 * the user write the header themselves.
 *
 * ## Why a portal
 *
 * A pane clips its own content; that is what makes a grid of terminals a grid.
 * Anything anchored inside a pane is therefore bounded by it, and a recap card
 * bounded by a narrow pane is the unreadable column described above. Fixed
 * positioning off the trigger's rect is the only placement that can be as wide
 * as the sentence needs while still pointing at the pane it belongs to.
