/**
 * "Continue interrupted" — the toolbar button that restarts work a restart stopped.
 *
 * ## The gap it closes
 *
 * Resuming a workspace brings the panes back and reconnects each one to the
 * conversation it was having. It cannot make the agents carry on: a coding CLI
 * launched on an old transcript reads it and then waits at its prompt. So an
 * agent that was halfway through a job comes back knowing every detail of it and
 * doing nothing — and on screen that is indistinguishable from a pane that
 * finished. The user's report was exactly that: the sessions were interrupted,
 * twelve terminals sat there, and nothing said which of them still had work.
 *
 * So: a button that checks, a list that says which panes are waiting, and one
 * click that types `continue` into them.
 *
 * ## Why a button and not an automatic nudge
 *
 * Sending "continue" to every resumed pane the moment a workspace comes back
 * would restart twelve agents on twelve unattended tasks because somebody
 * reopened a folder to look at one file. And an agent that was interrupted ON
 * PURPOSE ("stop, that is the wrong approach") would cheerfully resume the thing
 * it was told to stop. The offer is a click, never a side effect of opening a
 * workspace.
 *
 * ## Why it lists panes rather than just counting them
 *
 * Because "continue" is not one answer. A pane whose agent is not running cannot
 * be typed into at all, and each pane carries the job it was last given — which
 * is how somebody decides that two of the five are worth restarting and the
 * others are not. Both are shown BEFORE the click, not discovered after it.
