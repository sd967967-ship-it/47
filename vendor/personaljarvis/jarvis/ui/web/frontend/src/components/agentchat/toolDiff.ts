/**
 * A code-editing tool call → the diff it describes, ready to paint.
 *
 * A row that says `Edit src/app.ts` tells you a file changed and nothing
 * about WHAT changed, and the raw arguments underneath are worse: an `Edit`
 * carries its before and after as two JSON string literals, escapes and all,
 * so the one thing worth reading is the one thing you cannot (maintainer,
 * 2026-08-27, against Claude Code and Codex, which both paint the change).
 *
 * So this module turns whatever the agent's own tool vocabulary called it
 * into the same small shape: a list of files, each a list of lines marked
 * added / removed / context. Every coding CLI is covered because they
 * disagree about the field names and agree about nothing else:
 *
 * - Claude Code `Edit`            — `old_string` / `new_string`
 * - Claude Code `MultiEdit`       — `edits: [{old_string, new_string}]`
 * - Claude Code `Write`           — `content`, whole file, all additions
 * - Anthropic text editor         — `command: str_replace|create`, `old_str`
 * - Codex / OpenAI `apply_patch`  — a unified-ish patch as ONE string
 * - Notebook edits                — `new_source` against `old_source`
 *
 * Pure — no React — so the mapping is unit-testable and identical wherever a
 * diff is drawn.
