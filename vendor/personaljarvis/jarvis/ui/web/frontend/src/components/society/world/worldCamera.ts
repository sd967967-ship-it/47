 * Decisions (maintainer, 2026-09-01): a STEEP bird's-eye view — 50° below
 * the horizon at the classic 45° dimetric yaw — so the island reads as "seen
 * from above" while house fronts and figure silhouettes stay visible. Zoom
 * is five fixed steps (one field, four fields, the market district, a quarter
 * of the island, the whole island), never continuous: with an integer pixel
 * size every step stays crisp, and the widest step is the postcard view.
 *
 * Decision (maintainer, 2026-09-03): those two angles are the STARTING view,
 * not the only one. The viewer orbits the island — yaw all the way round, so
 * every building can be looked at from behind, and pitch between a low
 * street-level slant and a near-vertical map view. Both stay free (no snapping
 * mid-drag); the keyboard and the HUD compass step yaw in quarter turns so
 * getting back to the designed view is one click.
