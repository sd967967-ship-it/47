/**
 * The bell in the Agentic IDE header — "which of these terminals stopped?"
 *
 * ## The gap it closes
 *
 * A workspace is up to a dozen coding agents in panes the size of a postcard,
 * each working for anything between twenty seconds and half an hour. None of
 * them announces that it is done: the spinner row simply stops being drawn, and
 * a finished pane looks exactly like the eleven around it that are still
 * thinking. So the only way to know is to keep watching the wall — and the real
 * outcome is that work sits finished and unread until somebody happens to look.
 *
 * The bell counts what the backend noticed while nobody was looking; the panel
 * behind it lists the entries and takes you to the pane that raised each one.
 *
 * ## Why it opens as an anchored panel and not a modal
 *
 * The list exists to send you somewhere. A centred dialog with an overlay hides
 * the grid it is about, so "jump to T7" would mean reading a name, dismissing
 * the dialog, and finding T7 yourself. Anchored under the bell, the grid stays
 * visible behind it and the jump lands somewhere you can see happening.
 *
 * Rendered in a PORTAL for the same reason `PaneRecap` is: the header row is a
 * flex line of buttons that clips its own overflow, and a panel bounded by it
 * would be a few centimetres wide.
 *
 * ## What "read" means here
 *
 * Opening the panel marks everything read — the count is a "look at this",
 * and looking at it is the whole condition. The entries stay in the list until
 * they are discarded or their workspace closes, so nothing is lost by opening
 * it; only the badge goes quiet.
