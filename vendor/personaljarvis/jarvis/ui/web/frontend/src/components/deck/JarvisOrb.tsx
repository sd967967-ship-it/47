/**
 * The centre of the deck: the mascot itself.
 *
 * It used to be `/deck-orb.png` — a sphere cut out of the marketing render.
 * A picture of a light, not a light: its halo was baked in as milky white
 * pixels, so on the dark deck it read as a grey box, and the reticle around
 * it sliced that box off at the ring. The maintainer asked repeatedly for the
 * PNG to go and for the mascot to carry the product instead (2026-08-20), so
 * both PNGs are gone from the tree and the middle is Gigi, drawn as vectors:
 * sharp at any size, no edge to cut, no bitmap to ship.
 *
 * The staging is a dark figure standing in golden light. The glow behind it
 * (`.deck-orb-glow`, DeckOrb.tsx) throws the silhouette forward; the corona's
 * slow rays come up behind it in the voice. Gigi brings its own life — it
 * blinks, the pupils drift, it waves now and then, and with `reactToVoice` it
 * listens, thinks and speaks along. That is why the reticle around it no
 * longer needs to dance: the living thing is alive, the instruments stay
 * still until they have something to show.
 *
 * Voice moves the whole figure, honestly and cheaply. At rest a slow breath
 * (framer, a gentle loop). While something is happening, the VOICE itself:
 * the deck orb computes one level — the real microphone while listening, a
 * speech-shaped envelope while the assistant speaks, a heartbeat while it
 * thinks — and writes it to `--orb-level`; the reactor wrapper here scales
 * and brightens Gigi with it, and the corona behind it comes up in that same
 * light (CSS, index.css). The framer loops are therefore tiny: the level is
 * the motion. Dimmed and drained on an error. `prefers-reduced-motion` gets
 * the still figure.
