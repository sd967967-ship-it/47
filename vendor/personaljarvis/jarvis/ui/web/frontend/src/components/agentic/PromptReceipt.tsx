/**
 * Visible proof that a pane was handed a prompt — drawn by the app, never by
 * the agent's screen.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Jarvis composes a brief, types it into a pane and says so out loud. Until
 * this component, the ONLY evidence the user had was the pane echoing the text
 * back, and that evidence is missing in exactly the situations where somebody
 * would want it:
 *
 * - the pane had parked its output while it was off screen, and un-parking
 *   depends on an `IntersectionObserver` reporting its way out of states it
 *   does not report (see ./offscreenBuffer);
 * - the pane's socket was reconnecting, and a hidden window's timers are
 *   clamped, so "reconnecting" lasted minutes rather than half a second;
 * - the emulator had not painted yet, so the pane was a black rectangle;
 * - or the CLI simply redrew its input box somewhere the user was not looking.
 *
 * Every one of those has happened in production, and from the user's chair
 * they are one single experience: **Jarvis claimed it sent the brief and the
 * screen shows nothing.** The reasonable conclusion is that it did not, and no
 * amount of "but the agent really did get it" repairs the trust that costs.
 *
 * So the receipt is deliberately built from a DIFFERENT source than the screen:
 * the pane's own delivery record (`last_prompt_at`), pushed instantly over the
 * socket and read again from the state on every mount, reconnect and poll. If
 * the terminal is black, the socket is down and the observer is confused, the
 * receipt still appears.
 *
 * ## Why it does not simply fade away
 *
 * It shows for five seconds and goes (maintainer decision 2026-07-28, after
 * seeing it live). A receipt that lingers sits on top of the agent's output —
 * the pane is a terminal, and the bottom rows are where a CLI does its
 * talking, so a permanent bar buys certainty by covering the thing it is
 * certifying. Five seconds is enough to see WHICH pane was addressed and that
 * something real was sent, which is what was missing.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by leaving: the delivery stays in the pane's state and the
 * full text stays readable at `GET /terminals/{name}/prompt` (and through the
 * CLI), so a doubt that surfaces ten minutes later still has an answer. What
 * expires is the interruption, not the proof.
 *
 * Two deliberate exceptions, because both would turn "brief" into "broken":
 *
 * - a receipt the user is READING or pointing at stays until they are done —
 *   a panel that closes under the cursor is worse than one that never opened;
 * - a prompt that was typed but never STARTED stays, full stop. That is not a
 *   confirmation, it is a warning: the pane looks exactly like a working one
 *   and only the user can push it over the line. Hiding it after five seconds
 *   would recreate the original bug in a new place.
