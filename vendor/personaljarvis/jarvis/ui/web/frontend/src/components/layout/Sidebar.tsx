/*
 * Why `clsx` and not `cn` on the rows below.
 *
 * `cn` runs tailwind-merge, which decides that anything matching `text-*` that
 * is not one of ITS known size names is a text COLOUR. The design system's
 * scale — `text-body`, `text-meta`, `text-title`, `text-micro` — is not in that
 * list, so a class list holding both a size and a colour ends up with only the
 * colour: `cn("text-body", "text-muted-foreground")` returns
 * `"text-muted-foreground"` and the row silently falls back to the inherited
 * 16 px. Font size and colour are different CSS properties and never conflict
 * in the stylesheet, so plain concatenation is the correct behaviour here.
 *
 * The real fix is one line in `lib/utils.ts` — teach tailwind-merge the scale
 * via `extendTailwindMerge({ extend: { classGroups: { "font-size": [{ text:
 * ["display","page","title","reading","body","meta","micro"] }] } } })`. That
 * file is outside this change; once it lands these can go back to `cn`.
