/**
 * The update card under the voice bubble — what happened while you were talking.
 *
 * ## Why it exists next to the bell
 *
 * The bell in the header counts finished panes, but a counter is something you
 * have to go and look at. While the bubble is open the user is already looking
 * at the orb, and that is exactly the moment a terminal quietly finishes. So
 * the newest unread entry gets to say so where the eyes already are — one card,
 * newest only, never a list. The bell keeps the full history; this is a peek.
 *
 * ## What dismissing means here
 *
 * The X hides the card and nothing else: the entry stays in the bell, still
 * unread, still counted. A peek that could silently delete the record would
 * make the bell lie about work nobody has seen. The hidden ids live in a module
 * set so closing and reopening the bubble does not bring a waved-away card
 * back; a reload starts over, which is the honest reading of "still unread".
 *
 * Opening the bell marks everything read, and this card follows — the user has
 * seen the list, so the peek has nothing left to announce.
