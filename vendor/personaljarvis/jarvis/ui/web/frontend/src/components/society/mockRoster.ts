/**
 * Sample roster — stands in for society.db until the M1 backend is bound.
 *
 * Every value is deliberately static sample data (fixed timestamps, no chat
 * sessions) and the roster rail shows a "sample data" badge, so the preview
 * never pretends to be live state (the loading-states rule: an empty or
 * mocked surface must say so, not invent numbers).
 *
 * The first row is the demo of the lead: Jarvis as the society's chief
 * executive — a human figure in a dark suit who owns the whole team and
 * delegates everything (maintainer direction 2026-09-01). Every row carries
 * a figure recipe so the card, the rail and the island agree on the look.
