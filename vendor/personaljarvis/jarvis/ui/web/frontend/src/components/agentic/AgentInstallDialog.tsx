/**
 * "Install this CLI" — the whole flow, from the picker, without leaving it.
 *
 * The absence of a coding CLI used to be a dead end wearing a label: the entry
 * sat in the "open a terminal — what?" menu greyed out under the words NOT
 * INSTALLED, and the only way forward was to know that a CLIs page exists,
 * find it, and come back. Every registered entry that CAN be installed now
 * offers it where the user meets it (maintainer, 2026-08-23).
 *
 * Three things make this honest rather than a progress bar over a hope:
 *
 * 1. **The install runs in a real terminal the user can read.** `npm install
 *    -g` fails for reasons only its own output explains — a permissions error,
 *    a proxy, a Node that is too old. A spinner would hide every one of them.
 *    It is also the same PTY the CLI itself would run in, so a machine where
 *    the pane cannot start says so here rather than after the install.
 * 2. **"Installed" is a fresh probe, never an exit code.** A package manager
 *    that exits 0 has not proved that a binary is on this app's PATH — the
 *    recurring macOS/Linux symptom is exactly that gap. The dialog polls the
 *    single-entry recheck route, which re-augments PATH and looks, so the
 *    green line means the app can actually find and start the thing.
 * 3. **It reports failure as failure.** The dialog never closes itself on a
 *    guess; the user closes it, and the row behind it tells the truth either
 *    way at the next read.
