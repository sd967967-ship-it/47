/**
 * The meters that say how much of a subscription's plan is gone.
 *
 * What these pin down is the difference between a useful meter and a harmful
 * one. A percentage next to a seat is a number the user makes a decision on, so
 * the failures worth a test are the ones where it is confidently wrong or
 * quietly missing:
 *
 * * a reading that came off disk must never be presented as a live one;
 * * a per-model weekly budget must be drawn NEXT TO the overall week, because
 *   55% overall beside 99% on one model is exactly when "plenty left" is wrong;
 * * a limit this build has no name for must still be drawn, not hidden;
 * * a seat with no login must not repeat what the row above already says.
