/**
 * The floating voice bubble of the Agentic IDE — talk to the assistant while
 * the agents work, without giving up a column of the screen for it.
 *
 * It replaces the old fixed voice side panel: the terminals now own the whole
 * width, and the conversation surface is a bubble the user summons from the
 * toolbar and drags wherever it is least in the way. The position and the
 * open/closed choice are remembered per browser profile.
 *
 * One orb, a control row, the live transcript. Clicking the orb TOGGLES the
 * conversation: idle it arms a wake-style session (the same
 * `request_voice_session` path the call hotkey takes, so a click can never
 * behave differently from the wake word), active it hangs up. The wake word
 * keeps working in parallel — the bubble is the faster hand, not a
 * replacement. The mic button is the same toggle said explicitly; X hangs up
 * and puts the bubble away; the speaker mutes the assistant's voice for this
 * session only (never persisted — a forgotten mute must not survive a
 * restart).
 *
 * ## Why the bubble has no panel around it
 *
 * It used to be a rounded card: a 224 px slab of opaque background sitting on
 * top of the terminal wall for as long as the voice was open. The orb is the
 * only part of it that has to be seen, and the card was covering agents to
 * frame it. So there is no card — the orb, the status, the controls and the
 * update notice each carry their own small surface, and the space between them
 * is the workspace, visible and clickable.
 *
 * That last part is a rule, not an aesthetic: the wrapper is
 * `pointer-events-none` and every real control turns them back on. A
 * transparent-but-solid rectangle would eat clicks meant for the terminal
 * behind it, which is exactly the thing the card was already doing visibly.
 * Anything added here needs `pointer-events-auto` to work, and needs to deserve
 * the clicks it takes away from the pane underneath.
 *
 * Dragging still works anywhere on the orb, the status pill or the transcript —
 * they carry `data-drag-surface`, which is also where the pointer capture goes,
 * because a capture on the `pointer-events-none` wrapper is not delivered.
 *
 * Everything shown is read from the event store the voice pipeline already
 * feeds over the WebSocket (`voiceState`, the live transcription), so the
 * bubble costs no polling of its own and is exactly as current as the
 * sidebar's status dot. Files dropped on the orb are staged for the voice
 * conversation, same contract as the old panel and the native Jarvis Bar.
