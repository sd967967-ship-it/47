/**
 * The one badge on a pane: is anybody still owed something by this terminal?
 *
 * ## The question it replaced
 *
 * Every pane used to be labelled `live`, which answers a question nobody was
 * asking. `live` is a property of the PIPE — the socket is up and a process is
 * on the other end — and it stays true for a terminal that finished its work
 * twenty minutes ago, for one sitting on an unanswered permission prompt, and
 * for one grinding through a refactor. In a chat-mode list of a dozen agents,
 * that is a column of identical green dots next to twelve panes in completely
 * different states, and the user has to open each one to find out which.
 *
 * What a person actually wants to know is whether the agent is still WORKING or
 * has STOPPED, and this pill answers that instead. The pipe is still reported,
 * but only when it has something to say (connecting, exited, broken) — a
 * healthy connection is the boring case and is now spent on the useful claim.
 *
 * ## Why it holds for every coding CLI, including ones added later
 *
 * The distinction is not made here and not made from anything a product prints.
 * The backend derives it from the terminal SCREEN — a pane whose picture keeps
 * changing is working, a pane that stands still has stopped — which is a
 * property of the terminal rather than of whatever is running inside it. Two
 * earlier attempts read Claude Code's interrupt hint and Codex's bracketed
 * clock, and each broke on the next product and on the next release of its own.
 * See `jarvis/agentic_ide/activity.py`, which measured all four installed CLIs
 * before committing to the rule.
 *
 * So a CLI connected next year gets a working status pill with no code here,
 * and none there either.
 *
 * ## Why "done" and "idle" are not the same word
 *
 * A finished agent and a terminal nobody has ever spoken to show the SAME still
 * screen. Calling both "done" would invent a job for the second one, and be
 * read as "your work is ready" for a pane that has done none. `worked` — has
 * anything ever been asked of this pane, including the conversation it resumed
 * — is what separates them.
 *
 * Nothing here claims the work is CORRECT. "done" means the pane went quiet,
 * which is all a terminal can prove.
 *
 * ## Why motion means "busy" and colour means "ready"
 *
 * The two states a person scans this list for — still grinding vs. finished —
 * are told apart by SHAPE first, not by hue: a pane that is working shows a
 * turning spinner, and a pane that has finished shows a check mark. That reads
 * at a glance, survives every colour-blindness, and it is why the working state
 * is no longer a pulsing dot: a slow throb and a steady dot are the same
 * silhouette at 8 pixels, so the difference lived entirely in a colour the eye
 * had to compare against its neighbours to judge.
 *
 * The finished state is a CHECK and not a still dot for the same reason. A dot
 * is what every list uses for "online", and beside a row of green spinners a
 * green dot read as "also busy, just not animated right now" — the maintainer
 * asked for an indicator that says working or done, looking at a list that
 * already had one (2026-08-27). A check says finished the way a spinner says
 * busy: on its own, without a neighbour to compare against.
 *
 * Colour then carries the second question — is this pane's stillness news?
 * The product has three status hues and this badge uses all three and nothing
 * else. Green (life) marks a pane that is healthy: working, a check for a
 * finished job, a hollow ring for one that is merely ready and has done
 * nothing yet. Amber (degraded) is spent on the one state that wants an action
 * from you right now, a pane stopped on a question. Grey — which is ink, not a
 * status — is for a pane with nothing to report, red for a broken one.
 */

/**
 * The badge's vocabulary, as a key rather than a word.
 *
 * What a surface with room for a WORD asks for: the chat stage's header spells
 * the state out in the user's language, and it wants the state, not the
 * English label the tooltip carries. One key per look, so "done" and "idle"
 * stay two states there exactly as they are two looks here.
