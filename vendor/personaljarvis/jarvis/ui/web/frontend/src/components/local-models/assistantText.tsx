/**
 * The little bit of formatting a chat answer actually uses.
 *
 * A model writes `**bold**` and `` `code` `` in prose whatever you tell it, and
 * a panel that prints the asterisks reads as broken. This is deliberately NOT a
 * markdown renderer: the assistant's answer is a paragraph or three of prose,
 * so bold, italic and inline code are the whole vocabulary. Anything else
 * (headings, tables, links) is left as written rather than half-supported.
 *
 * `++text++` is folded into bold too — Gemini's own emphasis marker, seen in
 * every setup answer on 2026-08-25 and meaningless to a reader.
