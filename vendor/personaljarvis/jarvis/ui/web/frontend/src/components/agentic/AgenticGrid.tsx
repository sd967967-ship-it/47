        ONE container, and every pane is a direct child of it — placed by the
        fractions `paneLayout` computed rather than by where it sits in a tree
        of row and column elements.

        That is not a style choice. Every pane must stay MOUNTED for its whole
        life, because unmounting one tears down its WebSocket and kills the
        coding agent behind it. React re-parents children whenever the element
        tree changes shape, so nesting a container per column would remount
        panes on every split, close, and wrap. With one flat container the
        layout only ever changes numbers, and nothing moves in the DOM.

        It used to be a CSS grid, which gave that property for free — but a grid
        has ONE `grid-template-columns` shared by all of its rows, so two bands
        could never have different column widths, and every pane in a band was
        the same width whatever the user wanted. Fractional positioning inside
        one container keeps the mounting guarantee and drops that ceiling.

        The same reasoning covers maximizing: the other panes are HIDDEN with
        CSS, never removed, and the maximized one is told to fill the container
        instead of keeping its own rectangle.

        Chat view is the same trick one step further: switching modes only
        flips class names — every cell keeps its place in the element tree,
        so React re-parents nothing and no agent dies for a change of
        clothes. The list of sessions is the app sidebar's (WorkspaceChats),
        not a second column here.
