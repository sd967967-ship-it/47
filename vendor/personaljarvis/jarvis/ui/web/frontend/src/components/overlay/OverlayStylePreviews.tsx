 * Shared visual previews for the on-screen overlay styles (Bar / Mascot /
 * Voice orb / None).
 *
 * Lifted out of ``views/settings/OverlayTaskbarGroup.tsx`` so both the Settings
 * panel and the onboarding "System Style" step can render the same graphics
 * without one view importing the other. The mascot reuses the real Gigi SVG.
 *
 * The bar thumbnail draws its geometry from ``voiceBars`` — the same module the
 * live ``VoiceWaveform`` uses — so what the picker shows is the shape the user
 * actually gets. The PALETTE is deliberately not shared: this thumbnail is a
 * portrait of the DESKTOP overlay, which is gold on near-black whatever theme
 * the web UI runs in, so it keeps the renderer's literal colours. The live
 * visualizer sits inside the themed app and follows the theme instead.
 *
 * These are still previews, not instruments: they animate nothing. Three
 * thumbnails oscillating side by side on a settings screen is noise, and with
 * no microphone behind them any motion here would be invented.
 */

/*
 * This thumbnail paints its own ground rather than the app's, because it is a
 * portrait of the desktop overlay — which has no page behind it. So the values
 * are literals, not tokens, and they follow the same rule as the rest of the
 * monochrome pass: the frame recedes and only the content lifts.
