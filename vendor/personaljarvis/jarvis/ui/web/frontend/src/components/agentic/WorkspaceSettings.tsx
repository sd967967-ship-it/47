/**
 * The workspace's own settings, opened from the Agentic-IDE toolbar.
 *
 * One subject so far, and it is the one that has to be reachable from INSIDE
 * the workspace rather than three sections away in the app's settings: which
 * subscription the next terminal opens on. Someone running two Claude Max seats
 * decides that while looking at the panes — "the next one goes on the personal
 * plan" — and sending them out of the workspace to say so means losing the
 * screen they were reasoning about.
 *
 * Three things this surface is careful about:
 *
 * 1. **It says where the switch lands.** Switching applies to terminals opened
 *    from now on; every pane already on screen keeps the account it started
 *    with, because moving a running agent onto a plan whose history has never
 *    seen its conversation would make it amnesiac with no explanation.
 * 2. **It stays quiet when there is nothing to choose.** The active-account
 *    chips appear only once a second subscription of that CLI is registered.
 *    The gear itself is always there — it is also where the second one is added.
 * 3. **It is the SAME panel as the app's account page**, not a second copy of
 *    it. Only how the switch is applied differs: here it goes through the
 *    workspace, so the open session learns about it in the same round-trip.
