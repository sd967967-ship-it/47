/**
 * One named pane of the Agentic IDE: xterm.js wired to
 * `/api/agentic-ide/pty/{name}`, running one coding agent in the chosen folder.
 *
 * Two conventions matter here and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. The xterm instance lives in a ref, never in state — putting it in state
 *    re-renders the component on every output chunk and the pane stutters.
 * 2. Appearance and font size are applied to the LIVE instance in their own
 *    effects. Rebuilding the terminal when the user flips to dark mode would
 *    tear down the WebSocket, which kills the agent running behind it and
 *    loses the whole session. So the connect effect depends on pane identity,
 *    restart intent and one-way initial geometry readiness — never live
 *    appearance state.
 *
 * ## Why this pane is configured the way it is
 *
 * A coding agent's TUI is the hardest thing you can ask a web terminal to
 * draw: box-drawing frames, emoji status markers, live-rewritten spinner lines,
 * and a prompt box that redraws on every keystroke. Rendered with xterm's
 * defaults it came out visibly broken (reported 2026-07-25): text wrapped in
 * the wrong places, the frame characters drifted out of their columns, and
 * typing left artefacts behind. Four causes, all fixed here:
 *
 * * **Character width.** Without the Unicode 11 provider, xterm measures emoji
 *   and many box/symbol characters as one cell when the terminal on the other
 *   side counts them as two. Every such glyph then shifts the rest of the line
 *   by a column — which is exactly what "the frames look wrong" means.
 * * **ConPTY line semantics.** On Windows the agent runs behind ConPTY, which
 *   re-wraps and re-emits lines differently from a POSIX pty. xterm has a
 *   dedicated compatibility mode for it; without `windowsPty` the re-emitted
 *   lines stack up as duplicated, half-overwritten rows.
 * * **Measuring before the font is ready.** FitAddon derives the column count
 *   from one measured character. Run before the web font loads, it measures
 *   the fallback font, computes the wrong column count, and the agent then
 *   formats for a width the pane does not have. Worse, xterm keeps drawing the
 *   real font's wider glyphs into that too-narrow grid, so the text smears
 *   across its own columns. Neither `document.fonts.ready` nor a re-fit fixes
 *   this — see `@/lib/terminalFont`, which does.
 * * **Renderer.** The DOM renderer draws each cell as an element; with a TUI
 *   redrawing on every keystroke that is both slow and subtly misaligned. The
 *   canvas renderer draws on a grid, which is what a terminal actually is.

 * The floor under a pane's geometry — a CRASH GUARD, not a layout opinion.
 *
 * ## The rule this serves
 *
 * A terminal is exactly as wide as the tile it is shown in, and every
 * character inside that tile is visible. Nothing this pane draws may reach
 * past its own edge. That is the maintainer's rule for this screen
 * (2026-08-11), and it settles a run of attempts that each broke it:
 *
 * * **Clipping** (until 2026-08-11) rendered a fixed 60-column grid whatever
 *   the tile could show and cut the remainder off at the edge. Six terminals
 *   then each showed about two thirds of themselves, and the maintainer read
 *   the result — correctly — as terminals shoved behind one another. Adding a
 *   sideways scrollbar and two scroll shadows did not change what it was.
 * * **Auto-shrinking** (the same day) walked the pane's text size down until
 *   that 60-column grid fitted. It silently overrode the toolbar's size on
 *   every narrow pane — nine columns at ~5 px glyphs while the control read 20
 *   — so the size controls looked dead. Do not reintroduce it.
 *
 * So the fit is honest in both directions: xterm is given what the tile
 * measures, and the agent behind it is told the SAME number. The two must
 * never disagree — an agent laying lines out for 60 columns into an xterm
 * showing 33 re-wraps every one of them, and the TUI's cursor moves then land
 * on rows that no longer hold what they held when it drew them, which came
 * back as shredded one-word fragments (2026-08-10).
 *
 * ## What is left for this floor to do
 *
 * Only the absurd. A tile mid-layout measures 0, a hidden one measures
 * nothing at all, and a PTY resized to zero columns permanently wrecks the
 * agent's drawing. 10x4 is far below any arrangement a person builds on
 * purpose — with a workspace opening two panes deep (`WIZARD_COLUMN_HEIGHT`)
 * even twenty terminals leave roughly twice this — so in practice it is only
 * ever met by a measurement that is not real.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a floor on what a coding CLI needs. That question is
 * answered where it belongs: the launcher warns from twenty terminals up
 * (`CROWDED_TERMINAL_COUNT`) and opens as many as the user confirms. How many
 * agents fit on their display is theirs to decide, and a pane too narrow to be
 * useful is a pane they can see is too narrow — which is exactly what clipping
 * hid.
 *
 * The backend holds the same floor (`jarvis/agentic_ide/session.py`), so a
 * stale or older client cannot resize a PTY into nothing either.

 * spelling of "not measured yet". The server answers it by keeping the
 * geometry the pane already has — a running agent is not re-wrapped for a
 * size no tile ever had, a fresh one is spawned at the transcript's default —

 *
 * * a floor the backend enforced, which drew narrow panes wider than their
 *   window — read as terminals shoved behind one another (2026-08-11);

/**
 * What went wrong in this pane, and the one way out of it.
 *
 * ## Why a row of its own rather than a badge
 *
 * Both halves of this used to be somewhere else, and neither survived being
 * there. The reason was written INTO the terminal — an exit banner, or one
 * trouble line per kind of trouble (see `troubleShown`) — where the next thing
 * the pane draws scrolls it away and nothing brings it back; a user returning
 * to a dead pane found a still screen and no sentence explaining it. The way
 * out was a small button in the header, in the cluster that hides until the
 * pane is hovered or focused, competing for width with five others.
 *
 * A dead pane can afford the height. Its terminal is not being drawn into any
 * more, so the ~24 px this costs comes out of a static screen — and it buys the
 * two things that pane owes the user: what happened, and what to press.
 *
 * ## Why the live states show nothing
 *
 * `connecting` and `live` are answered better elsewhere and answered already:
 * the starting overlay covers a pane that has not painted yet, and the badge in
 * the header carries the state for anyone who looks. A standing strip for them
 * would take a row off every healthy pane in the workspace to say "fine".
