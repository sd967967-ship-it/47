/**
 * A terminal pane read as a chat — what the Agentic IDE's chat stage shows.
 *
 * The pane behind this is a live coding CLI in a PTY, and a TUI is a picture:
 * it cannot be read as a conversation off the screen. What CAN be read is the
 * record the CLI keeps for itself, which the backend serves in the agent
 * chat's own event vocabulary (`GET /terminals/{name}/timeline`). Those events
 * fold through the same reducer and draw through the same `ChatStage` as the
 * front page's chat — the thinking where it happened, each tool call with its
 * result, the answer as Markdown, the composer with its pills — because that
 * chat interface is the one the maintainer built for this and the one they
 * asked for here (2026-08-26: the old interface, not a plain box). The
 * pane's answers behind every field live in `store/paneChat.ts`.
 *
 * The terminal is never gone. Questions and permission prompts are asked in
 * the TUI and answered there, so the stage keeps one button back to the pane
 * itself, and says so out loud the moment the pane's activity reads "asking".

            the CLI, as the grid's header does; with one, the CLI's name
            steps aside to the right, the logo-sized fact it is.

            The line hugs its text rather than filling the header: the

            narrow header that IS the far edge — across a window-wide
