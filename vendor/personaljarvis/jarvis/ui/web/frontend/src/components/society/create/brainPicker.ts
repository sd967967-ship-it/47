/**
 * What the creator's "Runs on" picker lists: the seats an agent can sit on
 * RIGHT NOW on this machine, and nothing else (maintainer, 2026-09-02: a
 * provider that is not connected is not shown, one sentence says where to
 * connect it).
 *
 * A seat is one catalog row joined with the Agents tab's credential truth
 * (`joinProviderOptions`, the same join the chat's composer uses) plus, for a
 * vendor CLI on a plan, the subscription logins stored for it
 * (GET /api/society/providers). Three kinds, listed in this order:
 *
 *   subscription — a vendor CLI signed in on a plan (Claude Max, ChatGPT,
 *                  SuperGrok, Google): billed to the plan, not per token;
 *   api          — a provider's own endpoint behind a saved key;
 *   local        — a model on this machine (Ollama, a local server).
 *
 * Pure: no fetch, no store, so it is unit-tested with plain rows.

 * (maintainer, 2026-09-02: an empty "Local server" row beside Ollama is
 * noise). Rows whose list has not arrived yet are left out until it does.
 *
 * A subscription seat needs PROOF of a login, not just an installed binary:
 * a signed-in account this app can read (`accounts`), or a card on the
 * Agents tab that reports it connected (`known` — the ids that tab has a row
 * for). The chat's composer lists an installed CLI it cannot read the login
 * of (OpenCode, Kimi, Cursor…) and lets the turn say what is wrong; the
 * creator does not — "connect it first" is the whole point of this list.
