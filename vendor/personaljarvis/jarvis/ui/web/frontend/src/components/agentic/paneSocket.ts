/**
 * The socket that carries one Agentic-IDE pane: keystrokes out, the agent's
 * screen back.
 *
 * It exists as its own module because a pane's connection is the one place
 * where "the agent is broken" and "the wire is broken" get confused. The
 * server keeps a pane's agent running across viewers on purpose — a socket
 * that goes away means the VIEWER left, never that the work stopped, and the
 * next socket is handed the replay buffer that redraws the screen. A pane that
 * connected once and then gave up therefore reports a dead terminal while the
 * agent behind it is alive and still working.
 *
 * Two failure modes are handled here rather than in the component:
 *
 *  - **A rejected handshake (4401).** WebKit engines (WKWebView on macOS,
 *    WebKitGTK on Linux) do not attach the HttpOnly session cookie to a
 *    WebSocket handshake — BUG-065 — so a perfectly healthy session is turned
 *    away. Every other socket in the app already answers this by proving the
 *    session over plain HTTP and reconnecting with a one-time ticket; a pane
 *    that skipped it simply could not open a terminal on those platforms.
 *  - **A dropped connection.** A backend restart, a reload, a moment of
 *    unreachability. One failed attempt used to be final, which is why a
 *    whole grid of panes could go red at once and stay that way.
 *  - **A backend that is up but not ready.** After a restart the panes of a
 *    restored workspace reconnect within milliseconds — reliably before the
 *    workspace itself is back. That answer (4503) is a "not yet" and is waited
 *    out; only "not here" (4404) ends a pane for good.
 *
 * All three are bounded: a pane never hammers a backend that is genuinely
 * gone — it falls back to knocking every half minute — and whatever it ends up
 * believing, it says out loud.
 *
 * **Every one of those waits is measured by a timer, and a timer is the one
 * thing a hidden window does not honour.** Chromium clamps `setTimeout` in a
 * document that is not visible to roughly once per second, and to once per
 * minute after a few minutes of that — so a 500 ms retry becomes a second, and
 * the half-minute knock becomes a minute or more. Measured live 2026-07-27
 * 20:11: five panes reconnecting into a workspace that was still opening
 * knocked at 10.174, 11.174, 12.162, 13.170 — a flat one-second grid where the
 * backoff asked for 0.5 s, 1 s, 2 s, 4 s. The workspace opened at 20:11:24 and
 * the panes, by then deep in the slow schedule, surfaced their agents around
 * two minutes later with the work long since running. The agents were fine and
 * the prompts had gone out on time; only the screen was late.
 *
 * So the reconnect does not rely on the timer alone: coming back into view
 * retries immediately (see `onDocumentVisible`). The user looking at the pane
 * is the most reliable signal there is that the wait should end now.
