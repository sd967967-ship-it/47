/**
 * Two agents talking, drawn — the R3F half of `conversation.ts`.
 *
 * Everything it needs about WHERE the figures are it reads from
 * `walkerRegistry.ts`, the same per-frame map the minimap reads: positions
 * change 60 times a second and putting them through React would be absurd.
 * Everything it needs about WHO said WHAT it reads from the conversation
 * store, which changes a few times per sentence.
 *
 * What it writes back is one `SpeechPose` per participant: a heading to turn
 * toward and a flag for the `talk` clip. Never a position. A conversation
 * cannot move a figure (`world-behaviour-manual.md` §1) — the backend owns
 * where an agent is, and a figure that walked to another shop because it said
 * something would be the island inventing a third truth.
 *
 * Mounted OUTSIDE `<Shadowed>`: the ground pips are additive halos and a
 * translucent glow that casts a shadow reads as a hole in the grass.
