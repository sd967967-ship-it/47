/**
 * The controls the Agentic IDE's own screens are built from.
 *
 * ## Why this section does not use `.btn-primary` / `.btn-ghost`
 *
 * Those two are the app's marketing-weight controls: a full pill, 24 px of
 * horizontal padding, 12 px of vertical padding, and a 32 px yellow glow on
 * hover. They are right on a settings page with four buttons on it and wrong
 * here, where a single screen carries a folder browser, a count, and one row per
 * terminal. Sized like that, the launcher became a column of large soft shapes
 * with no hierarchy left to spend — every control shouted, so none of them led.
 *
 * These are the same design language one size down and one volume quieter:
 * 32 px tall, 6 px radius, no glow, and colour reserved. That reservation is the
 * actual rule and the reason this file exists:
 *
 * * **Yellow means one of two things** — "this is the choice you made" or "this
 *   is the one action that starts something". Nothing else may be yellow. An
 *   accent spent on decoration cannot also mark a selection, and this screen has
 *   real selections to mark.
 * * **Icons carry meaning or they are not there.** A rocket beside "Open" and a
 *   sparkle beside a heading tell the reader nothing they did not already read
 *   in the word next to it.
 *
 * Radii are a closed set across this section: `rounded-control` (6 px) for a
 * control, a row or a tile, and `rounded-surface` (10 px) for a panel. Both are
 * defined in tailwind.config.ts, where the note explains why the theme's own
 * `md`/`lg`/`xl` could not be used: they all resolve to 10-12 px, so nesting
 * them produced no sense of one thing sitting inside another.

/**
 * The ONE way a control in this section says it has keyboard focus.
 *
 * Exported rather than kept private because the terminal panes cannot use the
 * controls below and still need this: a pane header is coloured by the
 * TERMINAL's appearance — a light pane inside a dark app is a supported
 * combination — so its buttons carry their own palette rather than the theme's.
 * What they must not carry is their own idea of what "focused" looks like.
 *
 * Until this became shared, the pane header simply had none: every one of its
 * five actions was reachable by Tab and invisible once it got there, which on a
 * wall of a dozen panes means a keyboard user has no way to tell which terminal
 * they are about to close.
