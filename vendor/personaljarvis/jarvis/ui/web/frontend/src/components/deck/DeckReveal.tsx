/**
 * How a board instrument powers on when the board takes over from the start
 * stage — one beat of the launch (`lib/deckStandby.ts::HANDOFF`), timed from
 * the centre outward (`revealDelayMs`) so the board assembles around the orb
 * as the shockwave reaches each slot:
 *
 *   1. a targeting frame draws itself around the slot — a hairline rectangle
 *      drawn from the corner nearest the orb, four brackets sliding in to the
 *      corners;
 *   2. a beat later the card MOUNTS and its content wipes in AWAY from the
 *      orb — the centre column top-down, the left cards from their right
 *      edge, the right cards from their left (`revealWipeFor`) — with an accent
 *      scan bar riding the front and a two-frame flicker, the way a hologram
 *      settles;
 *   3. the wipe lands with a lock flash, and the ghost frame fades once the
 *      card's own frame underneath is there. The slot is now POWERED
 *      (`useDeckSlotPowered`), which is when a card may start anything heavy.
 *
 * The cards mount one beat each, not all at once, on purpose: mounting the
 * whole board in the click's own task froze the main thread for most of a
 * second (measured 2026-08-19: the 3D map's WebGL probe, the frames' layout
 * measurements), and every JS-driven animation — the orb's travel above all —
 * simply jumped. Staggering the mounts keeps the launch's first second free,
 * and a card that is heavy (the wiki's WebGL scene) waits for `powered`.
 *
 * Two boxes, on purpose: the OUTER takes the slot's place in the board's grid
 * (`className`, `style` — its size and position there) and hosts the frame,
 * bar and flash; the INNER lays the cards out (`bodyClassName`) and is the
 * one the wipe clips. A frame inside the clipped box would be wiped in with
 * the content instead of drawing ahead of it. Everything that moves here is
 * opacity, clip-path or a whole `transform` string — the values the browser
 * animates off the main thread.
 *
 * `reveal` is decided ONCE for the board's mount (MissionDeckView): a board
 * that mounts straight into a running session — a section change and back,
 * a reload mid-conversation — is simply there, children and all. Either way
 * the wrapper is the same element, so a card never remounts because the flag
 * moved. The overlays unmount when the power-on is over: nothing of it stays
 * in the DOM for the rest of the session.
 *
 * Reduced motion: no frame, no wipe, no bar — the same board, at once.
