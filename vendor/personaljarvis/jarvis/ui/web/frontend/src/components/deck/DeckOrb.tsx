/**
 * The centre of the deck: the mascot in a reticle — one hairline bezel, one
 * bright arc per running step, the voice meter, and four small readouts at
 * the corners.
 *
 * The middle is Gigi itself (`JarvisOrb`), moved by the real voice state,
 * with a soft accent glow throwing the dark silhouette forward. It was a PNG
 * of a glowing sphere until 2026-08-20; the maintainer had asked repeatedly
 * for that picture to go and for the mascot to carry the product, and the
 * picture had earned it — its baked-in white halo read as a grey box on the
 * dark deck, and this reticle sliced that box off at the ring.
 *
 * The reticle is now INSTRUMENTS ONLY, and every part of it carries
 * information: the arcs are parallel work made visible, the sweep turns only
 * while something runs, the meter is the voice, the readouts are live values
 * the caller sources. What went with the PNG was the scenery that measured
 * nothing — 72 dial ticks, corner brackets, two counter-turning orbits, a
 * satellite riding the bezel and an idle ping (maintainer, 2026-08-20:
 * instruments that show nothing are a stage set). The deck does not need
 * them to look alive: the living thing in the middle blinks, its pupils
 * drift and it waves, so the instruments can hold still until they have
 * something to say. Reduced motion stops what is left.
 *
 * And it MOVES WITH THE VOICE, all of it (maintainer, 2026-08-19: "when you
 * speak the sun moved — that, on the next level; not just the core, all of
 * it, smooth"). One animation-frame loop computes the orb's LEVEL
 * (`lib/orbLevel.ts`: the real microphone while listening, a speech-shaped
 * envelope while the assistant speaks, a heartbeat while it thinks), smooths
 * it, and writes it to ONE CSS variable on the root (`--orb-level`); the
 * core's size and brightness, the glow, the corona's rays, the rings and the
 * level arc on the bezel all read that variable in CSS (index.css). A jump
 * in the level — a word landing — sends one ripple from the sun to the
 * bezel. One number, one smoothing, so every part moves as one thing.
