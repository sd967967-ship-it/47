/**
 * The front page's waveform — the heart of the Jarvis bar.
 *
 * The overlay's `VoiceWaveform` is an SVG drawn for a small pill: a fixed
 * row of bars inside a fixed view box, and "at rest nothing animates". On
 * the front page the same drawing read as a thin dotted line lost in a big
 * card (maintainer, 2026-08-23: "sieht komisch aus"). This one is built for
 * the stage instead:
 *
 *   - it FILLS its container — capsule count follows the width, capsule
 *     height the height, on any window size and DPI;
 *   - at rest it breathes: a slow, low travelling wave, so the bar reads as
 *     alive-and-waiting rather than switched off (that is what the person
 *     sees most of the time);
 *   - while listening it is a TAPE: the newest microphone sample enters at
 *     the right edge and the whole row travels left, on the overlay's own
 *     attack/release and its own slower column cadence;
 *   - while the assistant SPEAKS it is the same tape, fed by the level of
 *     the audio actually leaving for the speaker — but only where this
 *     device can measure that (see `outputLevelRef`);
 *   - thinking, connecting, and speaking we cannot hear are a sweep; error
 *     is a still red row.
 *
 * ## Why it scrolls (maintainer, 2026-08-28)
 *
 * This row used to mirror the level outwards from the centre, and that is
 * the one shape it must not have: mirroring draws every syllable TWICE, so
 * a sentence becomes a symmetric blob and nothing in it can be told apart.
 * Scrolling keeps one peak per syllable, travelling, which is what lets
 * somebody look at the bar and see the words they just said. `ringValue`
 * (components/overlay/voiceBars) is the shared reader for exactly this, so
 * the front page and the overlay pill now scroll the same way.
 *
 * ## The shape (maintainer, 2026-08-28)
 *
 * A silent column is a small round DOT; a column with signal blooms into a
 * wide capsule. Two readings, one path — `capsule()` puts the radius at half
 * the short side, so the dot and the capsule are the same rounded rectangle
 * at two sizes and nothing ever cross-fades between two drawings.
 *
 * Width and height do NOT move together, and that asymmetry is the whole
 * effect. `bloom()` widens the dot on a steep knee, so the faintest signal
 * already opens the column to its full stroke, while the height keeps
 * climbing linearly far past that point. The row therefore reads as dots
 * that OPEN and then stretch, rather than bars that get taller — which is
 * what makes it look like breath rather than a chart.
 *
 * The lit core is a single vertical gradient over the WHOLE canvas, built
 * once per resize rather than per capsule per frame. Every capsule is
 * centred on the same midline, so one gradient gives all of them the same
 * light: a short one sits entirely inside the bright middle, a tall one
 * reaches the soft ends. That is the depth cue — the row looks lit from its
 * own centre line instead of flatly filled.
 *
 * ## The value ramp (maintainer, 2026-08-28)
 *
 * No hue. A pastel ramp was tried here and rejected: the interface is black,
 * white and grey, and a coloured row read as a different product bolted onto
 * it. What the row needed was not colour but a GRADIENT, so it takes one
 * along the value scale instead — `--muted-foreground` at the old end of the
 * tape, `--primary` at the new one.
 *
 * That earns its place twice. It stops the row being one flat tone, and it
 * says something true: the newest sound is the brightest, and every syllable
 * dims as it travels left and ages out. Unmeasured phases stay flat
 * `--muted-foreground` — they never reach the bright end, because nothing
 * measured them.
 *
 * Both ends are existing theme tokens, so this introduces no colour
 * vocabulary of its own and follows light/dark for free: on paper the ramp
 * runs mid-grey to ink, the exact mirror of grey to white on charcoal.
 *
 * Canvas rather than DOM capsules: forty to sixty shapes repainted every
 * frame are cheap on a 2D context and would be layout work as elements.
 * Every colour is read from the theme tokens on the element itself, so the
 * drawing follows light/dark and the wallpaper floor without a single
 * literal. Reduced motion keeps the information (a level meter) and drops
 * the decoration (no breathing, no sweep, no scroll).
