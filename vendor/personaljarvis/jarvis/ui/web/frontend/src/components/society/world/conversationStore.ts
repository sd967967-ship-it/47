/**
 * Which agents are talking right now, and what that asks of their figures —
 * the state half of `conversation.ts`.
 *
 * Two channels, on purpose, exactly like `retireStore.ts`:
 *
 *  - the zustand store carries the conversations themselves (who, which line,
 *    which beat). One changes a few times over a handful of seconds, so a
 *    React render per change costs nothing and the bubbles — which are DOM —
 *    can read it;
 *  - the pose map is a plain mutable `Map`, written and read inside
 *    `useFrame`, exactly like `walkerRegistry.ts`. A walker in a conversation
 *    reads its pose every frame; re-rendering React at 60 fps to turn a head
 *    would be absurd.
 *
 * The pose is deliberately weaker than the retirement ceremony's
 * `WalkerOverride`: it has no position, no pitch, no hidden flag. A
 * conversation may turn a head and open a mouth and nothing else
 * (world-behaviour-manual §1), so the two systems have no territory to fight
 * over — the ceremony owns where a figure is, speech owns where it looks.
 *
 * Every watchdog lives here rather than in the scene: a conversation no stage
 * ever picks up (the viewer is on the ledger, the canvas never mounted, WebGL
 * is gone) must still expire instead of sitting in the store forever.
