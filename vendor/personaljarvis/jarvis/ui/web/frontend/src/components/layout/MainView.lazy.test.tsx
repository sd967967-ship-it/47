/**
 * Every lazily loaded section must actually resolve to a component.
 *
 * Why this test exists (2026-07-26): MainView switched from static imports to
 * `lazy(() => import(...).then((m) => ({ default: m.SomeView })))` to keep the
 * startup bundle small. That trade moves one class of error from build time to
 * click time — a wrong path or a mistyped export name no longer fails the
 * build, it fails silently until a user opens that one section and gets an
 * error boundary. TypeScript cannot catch it either, because the unwrap
 * produces `undefined` rather than a type error.
 *
 * So this walks MainView's own source, extracts each (module path, export
 * name) pair it lazily loads, and proves the export really exists. Reading the
 * source rather than a hand-kept list means a newly added section is covered
 * the moment it is written, and cannot be forgotten here.
