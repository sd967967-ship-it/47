/**
 * "What should run in the new terminal?" — the one menu behind every action
 * that opens a pane.
 *
 * It lives on its own rather than inside the pane header because opening a
 * terminal is not something only a pane does: the grid's split buttons ask it,
 * the chat view's rail asks it, and an empty workspace asks it. Those surfaces
 * used to disagree — a split offered the choice while the rail silently started
 * whatever CLI happened to be first, so the chat view could only ever add more
 * of the same agent (maintainer report 2026-07-31). One component keeps them
 * telling the same story.
 *
 * Before any of them asked, a new pane inherited the anchor's agent silently,
 * which made running a Codex pane next to a Claude Code one impossible from the
 * workspace — you had to close it and start again from the wizard. The backend
 * always accepted an agent per terminal; this is the surface that asks.
 *
 * The list is whatever the backend registered, so it is not a fixed pair of
 * CLIs: a plain terminal (this machine's own shell, no agent around it) sits in
 * the same menu, and a CLI registered later appears here without a change on
 * this side. An entry that is not installed stays listed but disabled, so the
 * absence is visible and explains itself rather than silently not being there —
 * and where an install command exists it carries an Install button, so the
 * absence is fixable from the menu instead of only from the CLIs page
 * (maintainer, 2026-08-23). The install runs in a real terminal the user can
 * read, and "installed" is a fresh probe rather than an exit code; see
 * `AgentInstallDialog` for why both of those matter.
