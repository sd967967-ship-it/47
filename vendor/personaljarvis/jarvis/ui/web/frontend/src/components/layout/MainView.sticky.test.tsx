/**
 * The Agentic IDE survives a section change; every other section does not.
 *
 * Why this test exists (2026-07-29): sections were all switched the same way —
 * one mounted, the rest thrown away — and for a section whose contents are
 * live terminals that is destructive rather than economical. Leaving the IDE
 * disposed a dozen xterm instances and their sockets; coming back built new
 * ones and had the backend replay every pane's screen into them, and until
 * that finished the freshly mounted view knew of no workspace at all and drew
 * its ONBOARDING WIZARD in front of a workspace that had never stopped running
 * (maintainer report, ~3 s of "start over" on the way back).
 *
 * So the assertions here are about identity, not appearance: the same instance
 * must still be there afterwards, un-remounted, merely hidden — and it must be
 * TOLD it is hidden, because a `display: none` subtree cannot measure that for
 * itself and its polling would otherwise run for nobody.
