 * behind it worth hinting at, and a dialog over a half-built app looked
 * exactly like what it was. Fails open (renders nothing) while loading or on
 * a fetch error so a broken guide never traps the user. `?onboarding=force`
 * forces the flow for non-destructive dev replay.
 *
 * The risk acknowledgement lives INSIDE the flow's first step now (it used to
 * be a separate screen before a separate video screen before the wizard).
 * Its acceptance is awaited and persisted there; nothing about
 * onboarding/completed state changes until the final step, so the
 * restart-loop bug cannot come back through this path.
