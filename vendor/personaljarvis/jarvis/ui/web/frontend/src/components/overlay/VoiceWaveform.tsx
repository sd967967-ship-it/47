/**
 * The live voice visualizer — the same pill the desktop overlay draws, fed by
 * real microphone levels.
 *
 * Two looks, and which one is shown is a statement of fact rather than a
 * styling choice:
 *
 * - **waveform** (``listening``) — a scrolling history of MEASURED microphone
 *   levels. The newest sample enters at the right edge and the row travels
 *   left, so the shape on screen is what the user actually said a moment ago.
 * - **sweep** (``connecting`` / ``working`` / ``speaking``) — a travelling
 *   highlight for activity that is real but NOT measured here: the socket
 *   opening, the transcription and reply running after the turn was committed,
 *   the assistant's own speech (the browser has no output level tap). It
 *   promises motion and nothing more, so the visualizer can never imply a
 *   microphone reading it does not have.
 *
 * Nothing in the animation goes through React state: the level arrives at
 * ~30 Hz from the capture worklet and is read from a ref inside one
 * ``requestAnimationFrame`` loop that writes SVG attributes directly. A
 * ``setState`` per level sample would re-render the whole control 30 times a
 * second to move seven pixels.
