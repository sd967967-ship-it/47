/**
 * What the app shows after something is installed from the marketplace.
 *
 * Installing used to be a one-way trip: the thing landed somewhere on disk and
 * no view could say it had arrived, let alone where it came from. These tests
 * pin the three places that now answer that — a plugin in Plugins, a skill in
 * Skills, a picture in Wallpaper — because "it installed fine" is worth
 * nothing to somebody who cannot find it.
