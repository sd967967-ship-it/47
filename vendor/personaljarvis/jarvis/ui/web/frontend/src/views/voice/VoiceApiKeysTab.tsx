 * saved here is therefore the same stored credential the API-Keys view shows,
 * and vice versa — the two screens are never mounted at the same time
 * (`MainView.SwitchOnActiveSection` renders exactly one section), and
 * `ApiKeyForm` announces every save/delete on the window event bus that
 * `useProviders` / `useSectionHealth` already listen to, so whichever screen is
 * opened next reads the current truth.
 *
 * The Realtime|Pipeline engine switch deliberately does NOT ride along
 * (maintainer feedback 2026-07-29). This section is about turning speech into
 * text; picking the voice ENGINE is a different decision, and it already has
 * one home with the full explanatory context next to it — the API-Keys view's
 * `EngineModeSwitch` + `VoiceEngineContext`. A second switch here read as a
 * stray control in a section that never asked the question. Do not add it back.
