/**
 * Agentic IDE — the "code with Jarvis" section.
 *
 * Two states in one view:
 *
 * * no workspace open → a five-step wizard: folder, how many terminals, an
 *   aggregate agent allocation, grid or chat view, then start,
 * * workspace open → the terminal grid (see AgenticGrid).
 *
 * The wizard order is deliberate and matches how the decision actually gets
 * made: you know the folder first, the number of panes second, then which agent
 * sits in which pane, and last how you want to read them. Every step is
 * reversible and nothing is started until the last one.
 *
 * i18n note: the section label and view header go through the locale files; the
 * panel copy inside is still English-only source awaiting its i18n keys.

 * explaining the lead-in. That is feature-list prose: it advertises a thing the
 * reader has already chosen and opened, and the bolding makes the eye skip
 * precisely the half that carries the information. The same four facts as four
 * plain sentences take a third of the room and are actually read.
 *
 * It stays a dialog rather than becoming a toast because it appears exactly once
 * per machine and describes a mode change the user did not ask for — which is
 * the one thing on this screen worth interrupting for.
