  //      was silently dropped. A window listener catches the chord no matter
  //      which control has focus.

  //      pressed together (WASD, F7+F8, I+Y) — which the global-hotkeys backend
  //      registers natively (the Call default is f3+f4) — all land in the combo
  //      instead of only the first one.
  //   3. Commit on FULL release, not on the first keyup. We track every
  //      physically-held key (incl. modifiers, by `event.code`) and only commit
  //      once the user has let go of everything. Committing on the first keyup
  //      ended the recording the instant any one key lifted, so a human pressing
  //      a chord (whose key releases are never perfectly simultaneous, and whose
  //      presses roll in one after another) only ever got the first key — the
  //      reported "press several, only one is recorded" bug. Now the rule is the
  //      natural one: "hold your keys, then let go".
  // preventDefault on both edges also stops the keystrokes from leaking into
  // the rest of the app while recording (the "everything lags" symptom).
  // What Escape restores: the SAVED value (the server truth), falling back to
  // the combo as of recording start when nothing is saved yet. Kept in a ref so
