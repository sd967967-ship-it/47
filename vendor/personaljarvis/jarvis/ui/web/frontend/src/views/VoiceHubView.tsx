/**
 * Combined voice section — everything that turns speech into text, behind one
 * sidebar entry:
 *
 *   [ Dictation ] [ Dictionary ] [ Shortcuts ] [ Language ] [ API Keys ]
 *
 * Same merged-section pattern as ExtensionsView / ClisHubView: the active
 * sidebar section id IS the tab state, so voice deep-links ("open the
 * dictionary") and the NavigateSidebar event keep landing on the right tab with
 * no extra routing.
 *
 * One difference from those two precedents, and it is deliberate: the section
 * title is rendered ONCE here, above the tab bar, instead of each child drawing
 * its own header below it. Two stacked bordered bands read as a rendering fault,
 * and the merged brand ("{name} Voice") belongs above the tabs it fronts — so
 * every child is asked to stand its header down via `hideHeader`.
 *
 * The title comes from the `nav.voice` locale value, which carries the `{name}`
 * token; `useT()` substitutes the live wake-word brand. Never hardcode a name
 * here.
