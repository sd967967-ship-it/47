/**
 * Give the agent board a memory.
 *
 * The board used to render only `JarvisAgentRegistry`, which is an in-memory
 * bus subscriber that drops a finished node after a 60 second TTL and starts
 * empty on every app start. So unless you happened to be looking at the screen
 * within a minute of a run, every number read 0 and the table read "no agents
 * are running right now" — even with hundreds of completed runs on disk. The
 * live view was working exactly as built; it just had nothing durable behind
 * it.
 *
 * The durable record already exists: the missions table behind `/api/missions`,
 * which is the SAME thing the board calls an agent — `rows.ts` describes a
 * mission as the root node carrying the task text. So the board now shows the
 * union: live registry nodes (which carry tool calls and tick in real time)
 * plus the mission history underneath them.
 *
 * A run present in both wins as its LIVE node, because only that one has the
 * tool calls and the running clock.
 *
 * A third, optional source is the outputs archive (`/api/outputs`): it knows
 * the run's terminal reason, its one-line summary and — most usefully — the
 * slug of the directory the deliverables live in. Where a row's mission is in
 * that list, the row learns its reason, summary and output slug; where it is
 * not (the directory was cleaned up), the row keeps what it had.
