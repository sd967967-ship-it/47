/**
 * "Set up everything" — the one-click flow behind the Local models overview,
 * written as a pure async function so it can be tested against a faked
 * `fetch` and driven from a hook (`useLocalSetup`).
 *
 * The steps, in order, each reported through `report`:
 *
 *  1. server   — the overview is read LIVE. A local server that is installed
 *                but stopped is started; one that is not installed is
 *                installed (the button that starts this flow names the
 *                install, so the click is the consent) and then started; a
 *                remote server that does not answer stops the flow with the
 *                backend's sentence.
 *  2. plan     — the roles' recommendations are read from that live overview,
 *                so they come from what is on the server NOW: the best
 *                installed download per role, a download only where nothing
 *                installed qualifies.
 *  3. pull     — every recommended model that is missing is downloaded once.
 *  4. assign   — each writable role that is not already on its pick is set.
 *  5. tune     — the suggested options are written for every model assigned.
 *  6. verify   — three real round trips (`POST …/verify`): the server, one
 *                chat answer, one embedding — so "set up" is a tested sentence.
 *  7. save     — "start the server with Jarvis" is switched on for a local
 *                server, so the next start needs no click at all.
 *
 * A role that is served elsewhere (the wiki embedding on a cloud provider,
 * the voice server not installed) or has no pick is skipped and named in
 * the summary; a role whose write fails is skipped with the reason and the
 * flow goes on — one refused slot must not undo the other four.
 *
 * Nothing here touches react-query or i18n: the caller repaints and renders
 * the sentences.
