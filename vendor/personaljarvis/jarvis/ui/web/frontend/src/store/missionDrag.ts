/**
 * Shared "a mission card is being dragged" flag.
 *
 * The drag source (a rail row in the Artifacts section, via `lib/missionDnd`)
 * and the drop surface
 * (`JarvisDock`, far away in the tree) need to agree that a drag is in flight so
 * the dock can bloom into a big, forgiving target and mount its full-window
 * catch layer. A tiny zustand store is the lightest way to bridge them — same
 * pattern as `useEventStore` / `useI18nStore`.
 *
 * `begin()` is called from the source `onDragStart`; `end()` from its
 * `onDragEnd` and from every drop handler, so the bloom always tears down
 * whether the user drops on target, tosses near it, or cancels with Esc.
