/**
 * The mission deck's own store: what its cards show, and which surface the
 * "chats" section is on.
 *
 * Fed from the WebSocket hook with one `ingest` call per event, the same way
 * the command-activity and thinking-trace stores are. Kept apart from the big
 * event store because none of this is read anywhere else — and because the
 * reducer returns the same object for the (vast) majority of events, which
 * `set` turns into a no-op without waking a single subscriber.
 *
 * The surface mode lives here rather than in a view's local state so the app
 * shell can read it: on the deck the sidebar gives way to the deck's own dock
 * (App.tsx), and a view cannot tell the shell that from the inside.
