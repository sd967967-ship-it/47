/**
 * Which desktop wallpaper the app is wearing — one choice PER THEME.
 *
 * Every catalog picture is authored for one of the two modes (a daylight
 * terrace for light, a moonlit ocean for dark), and picking one switches the
 * app into that mode (`useApplyWallpaper`). A single shared slot therefore
 * could not survive a manual theme toggle: the bright picture stayed behind
 * dark chrome and read as a mistake. Each mode keeps its own pick instead,
 * and toggling the theme brings that mode's picture back with it.
 *
 * The bundled artwork stays the default and the fallback — one picture PER
 * MODE (useDesktopWallpaper): an empty selection means "the one that ships
 * with the app for this mode", so a fresh profile, a cleared browser storage,
 * and a checkout without the generated library all land on a known-good
 * picture authored for the mode on screen rather than on a blank shell — or,
 * as it was until 2026-08-18, on the night scene under light chrome.
 *
 * The choice lives in localStorage rather than on the server. It is a per-
 * screen cosmetic preference with no backend meaning, and localStorage is the
 * one store every window of the app — including the detached solo windows —
 * already shares.

 * of its own inherited the other mode's picture, forever. A wallpaper belongs
 * to exactly one mode, so the fallback is gone and the stored pick is filed
 * once, under the mode it was authored for.
 *
 * The single-slot world switched the interface into every adopted picture's
 * mode and persisted that switch, so the cached theme at the moment this first
 * runs is the best witness for which mode the old pick belongs to. Worst case
