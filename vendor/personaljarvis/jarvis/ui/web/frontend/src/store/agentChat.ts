/**
 * The agent chat's store — one per SURFACE (`createAgentChatStore`).
 *
 * The front page's store (`useAgentChatStore`, surface `jarvis`) is Jarvis
 * with a keyboard: what is typed there goes to the same assistant the
 * microphone reaches, and its sessions are the front page's chats. An
 * Agentic IDE store (surface `agent`) holds coding sessions instead. Each
 * store asks the backend for its own list and catalog, stamps its surface on
 * the sessions it creates, and keeps its own socket and draft.
 *
 * One active session at a time: its timeline is fed by one WebSocket
 * (snapshot, then live events, reconnect from the last seq). The composer's
 * choice of provider / model / effort / permission mode lives here as the
 * DRAFT: for a fresh chat it is what the next session is created with; with
 * a session open, changing a pick patches that session on the backend and
 * the same draft mirrors it. The draft survives a reload (localStorage) so
 * the composer opens on what you used last, like the Claude app does.
 *
 * The provider list is the backend catalog (`/api/agent-chat/catalog`)
 * joined with the Agents tab's credential truth (`/api/jarvis-agent/status`):
 * a provider is offered when it is connected — a key saved, a subscription
 * logged in, or a local server — and shown greyed out with a "connect" hint
 * otherwise. The one marked active on the Agents tab is the draft's default.
 */
