"""REST-API for the Outputs view (`/api/outputs`).

Lists the per-mission work directories across the canonical and retained legacy
output roots, optionally enriched with mission status from the Phase-6
`missions.db`. Read-only.

Why a thin filesystem endpoint and not a frontend rewrite to `/api/missions`:
the Outputs view was built around the on-disk work directory layout (slug,
mascot-style utterance preview, "open in Explorer"). Missions are a logical
abstraction one level deeper (the `tasks/<mission_id>/workspace/` subdir).
Keeping the dir listing as the primary index lets users open the worktree
even when the mission row is gone (DB pruned, recovery cleanup).
