"""Is the frontend build on disk whole enough to hand to a browser?

``index.html`` and the hashed bundles it points at are written by separate
steps of one ``npm run build``, and Vite runs with ``emptyOutDir: true`` — so
``dist/`` passes through a state where ``index.html`` is still the OLD one
while ``dist/assets/`` has already been deleted. Measured on 2026-08-22 with a
200 ms poll against the live server during a real rebuild:

* 1.8 s serving the previous ``index.html`` whose ``<script type="module">``
  answered 404,
* then 5.2 s with no ``index.html`` at all (the holding page),
* then the new build.

The middle 5.2 s are harmless: the holding page refreshes itself. The first
1.8 s are not. A window that loads that document gets the boot splash, its
entry bundle 404s, and NOTHING further runs — no React, no bundle watch, no
preload recovery. The only thing left is the blank-window watchdog in
``index.html``, which allows a splash 20 seconds before it acts. Twenty seconds
of a near-black window with a small spinner is what gets reported as "it goes
black when it reloads by itself".

The fix is to never serve that document. An ``index.html`` whose own entry
assets are not on disk is not a page, it is a trap: the caller falls back to
the holding page, which says what is happening and comes back on its own.

Deliberately un-cached. The whole point is that ``index.html`` can stay
byte-identical while the files underneath it disappear, so a result keyed on
its mtime would be exactly wrong. Costs one small read plus a handful of
``stat`` calls, on a route a window hits when it loads and once per bundle-watch
poll.
