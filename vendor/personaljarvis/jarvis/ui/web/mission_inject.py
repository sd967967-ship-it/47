"""Compose the brain-turn directive for a mission dragged into the conversation.

A dropped Outputs card carries its own display text (utterance / status /
summary / error). We turn that into one clean, bounded, human-readable user
turn. Publishing it as ``MessageSent(role="user")`` reuses the whole existing
brain pipeline — the reply is spoken on the voice build and shown in chat, and
the text lands in the brain's history (the "context window") so follow-ups work.
