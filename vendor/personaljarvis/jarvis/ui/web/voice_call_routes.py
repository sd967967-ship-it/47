"""REST API for the voice orb — start or end a conversation without speaking.

Endpoints (mounted by the WebServer in ``_build_app()``):

    GET  /api/voice/state   → is a speech pipeline running, and what it is doing.
    POST /api/voice/call    → arm a wake-style voice session (the click-shaped
                              wake word — same path as the call hotkey).
    POST /api/voice/hangup  → hard-stop the voice channel (same contract as the
                              hangup hotkey).

The click path is deliberately the SAME one the call hotkey and the chats
"Speak in this conversation" button take — ``SpeechPipeline.request_voice_session``
— so a click on the orb can never behave differently from the wake word beyond
skipping the audio trigger. Under the CLI-first contract these routes also make
the orb's actions scriptable as ``jarvis api voice <op>``.

No Brain dependency; on a headless install (no microphone, voice disabled) the
state endpoint answers honestly and the actions 503 instead of 500-ing.

    transition never sees it and keeps whatever it heard last. A window that
