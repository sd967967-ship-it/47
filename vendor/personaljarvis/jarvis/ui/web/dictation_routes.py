"""REST API for dictation mode — hold a key, speak, text lands where you type.

Endpoints (mounted by the WebServer in ``_build_app()``):

    GET    /api/dictation/status    → capability + live state + the shortcuts.
    POST   /api/dictation/start     → begin a dictation ({"target": ...}).
    POST   /api/dictation/stop      → finish the running one.
    POST   /api/dictation/paste-last → insert the last dictation again.
    GET    /api/dictation/history   → recent dictations (raw + cleaned).
    GET    /api/dictation/stats     → lifetime totals, today, day streak.
    DELETE /api/dictation/history   → purge everything (destructive).
    DELETE /api/dictation/history/{id} → drop one entry.
    POST   /api/dictation/history/{id}/discard → soft-delete (recoverable).
    POST   /api/dictation/history/{id}/restore → un-discard, re-transcribe.
    GET    /api/dictation/settings  → the [dictation] block.
    PUT    /api/dictation/settings  → change one or more keys.
    POST   /api/dictation/polish/test → dry-run the polish pass on a sample.

Delete has two shapes on purpose. ``DELETE /history/{id}`` keeps hard-delete
semantics because that is the contract anyone scripting ``jarvis api dictation``
already relies on; the UI's trash icon calls ``POST .../discard`` instead, so a
mis-click stays recoverable. Both of them, and the full purge, take the audio
sidecar with them — a "deleted" dictation the app still holds a recording of
would be a quiet lie.

Why REST and not only the WebSocket command the chat mic button uses: under the
CLI-first contract (CLAUDE.md §5) a capability that exists only in the UI is not
finished. Mounting this router also makes every action a
``jarvis api dictation <op>`` command for free — and *that* is the documented
fallback on Wayland, where the compositor owns global shortcuts and the app
cannot bind one itself.

No Brain dependency, so it works headless and with a MockBrain; on a host with
no microphone the status endpoint answers honestly instead of 500-ing.

**Sync or async is a deliberate choice per handler, not a style.** The history
is a JSON file that is parsed whole on every read and rewritten on every write,
and a purge unlinks every audio sidecar — blocking work that must never sit on
the event loop a live voice WebSocket shares. Two shapes, no third:

* Everything that only touches the history/stats files is a plain ``def``, so
  FastAPI runs it in its threadpool and the blocking call costs the loop
  nothing (the precedent this follows is ``dictionary_routes.py``).
* Everything that touches the *running pipeline* stays ``async def``, because
  those calls are loop-affine: ``start_dictation`` needs
  ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` and would return a false "could not start"
  from a worker thread, and ``stop_dictation`` / ``set_keybinds`` set an
  ``asyncio.Event``. Where such a handler also has blocking work to do
  (``PUT /settings`` persisting, restore's re-transcription) that work goes
  through ``asyncio.to_thread`` — never half of it.

    credentials on this host, and the privacy rule on top of it. A frontend
    that re-derived the order would be the AP-4 drift trap: the card would name
    one provider while the dictation used another, and neither the user nor a
    bug report could tell which was lying.

    So the answer comes from the resolver itself, and carries the one thing a
    user can act on — the credential slot to fill when the chain came back
    EMPTY. An empty chain is the honest "nothing will answer" state, and it is
    what a fresh clone with no key looks like (AP-23).

    Off the event loop: the resolver reads up to seven credential slots, and a
    locked keyring blocks for seconds. That is the same reason the pass itself
    runs it in a worker thread.
