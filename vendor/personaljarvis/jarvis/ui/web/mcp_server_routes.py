"""Jarvis' two outward MCP surfaces, on one mount.

* ``/api/control/mcp``        — Jarvis' own TOOLS, so a session Jarvis spawned
  can reach back in and drive the app: open an app, read the wiki, switch
  provider. The model's hands are the voice's hands.
* ``/api/control/mcp/agents`` — the AGENT ECOSYSTEM, for any client holding the
  control key: the roster, the board, rooms, assignments, approvals. This is
  what lets Claude Desktop, Cursor or another Jarvis talk to the team.

Mounted as a raw ASGI sub-app rather than a FastAPI router: the MCP Streamable
HTTP transport needs the untouched ``(scope, receive, send)`` triple — it
streams, negotiates its own content types and answers ``GET``/``DELETE`` as
well as ``POST``. Wrapping that in a response model would fight it.

ONE mount serves both, choosing on the rest of the path (``_surface_for``); two
Starlette mounts cannot, because a ``Mount`` requires a path segment AFTER its
prefix and a plain ``POST /api/control/mcp/agents`` would silently fall through
to the shorter one.

Authentication is the Control API's Bearer key, checked here instead of by a
dependency for the same reason. The rule is the Control API's rule (see
``control_auth``): loopback does NOT bypass it. The key is exactly what makes
these surfaces safe to exist — anything on the machine could otherwise open a
socket and start driving the person's calendar, or their agents.

Each surface keeps its own stateless session manager (a fresh transport per
request), so a chat turn that dies mid-tool leaves nothing to clean up. Their
task groups start on first use and live for the process — there is no lifespan
hook on this app to hang them from, and one background task per surface is
cheaper than one per request.
