"""Standalone launcher for the desktop app.

Usage:
    python -m jarvis.ui.web.launcher           # full desktop app
    python -m jarvis.ui.web.launcher --headless # backend only, no window
    python -m jarvis.ui.web.launcher --dev      # dev_mode=True

This launcher is DELIBERATELY separate from jarvis/__main__.py so Phase 1a and
Phase 1b can be developed in parallel without merge conflicts.
Integration into __main__.py happens in a later merge turn.

    DESKTOP instance's actively-running missions to ``FAILED('crash_recovery')``.

    A headless run that is the SOLE instance (the €5-VPS case) holds the lock

    A bind failure on the admin port immediately after an in-app self-restart is
    almost always *transient*: the just-exited old process is still releasing the
    socket, not a live second instance holding it. Treating that first failure as
    "already running" (and bouncing) is the "shuts down but never comes back" bug
    — so retry the bind a few times before giving up. The single-instance lock
    (acquired later in :func:`_desktop_backend_main`) stays the authoritative
    "is another instance live?" check; this only prevents the transient race from
    being misread.

    A fresh ``FastBootstrap`` is built per attempt (a failed ``serve`` leaves a
    spent uvicorn server on the object — never reuse it). Returns the bound
    bootstrap, or ``None`` if every attempt failed (the caller then maps that to
    "already running"). The normal start (free port) binds on the first attempt
    with no delay; only a genuinely, persistently-bound port pays the full backoff.
