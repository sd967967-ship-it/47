"""WebSocket endpoint for the wiki live-reload stream.

Path: ``/api/wiki/live``.

Protocol
--------
- Server -> Client: one JSON message per debounced :class:`WikiPageChanged`
  event::

      {"type": "page_changed", "slug": "harald",
       "path": "entities/harald.md", "kind": "modified"}

- Client -> Server: no inbound messages are expected. The frontend uses
  this as a subscribe-only stream and re-fetches via REST after each
  message.

Per-client bounded queue
------------------------
Each connected client owns its own :class:`asyncio.Queue` with
``maxsize=64``. If the queue fills up (the client is slow to drain), new
events are **dropped** rather than back-pressuring the bus. A slow UI
must not be allowed to delay the wiki watcher or the curator that
publishes events through the same bus.

A reconnecting client will re-fetch all four REST endpoints on
``onopen``, so a missed event during a drop period is recovered by the
next fetch — there is no need to replay missed events here.
