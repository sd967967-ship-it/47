"""REST surface of the "Local models" section.

Inventory, unload and delete; the four roles; per-model options and the
suggestion for this machine; the public catalogue; Hugging Face GGUF
browsing (off until switched on); and the server itself (status, stop,
probe, log, environment guide).

Everything the section shows about what is INSTALLED on the pull-capable
local server (Ollama today) lives here, separate from ``provider_routes.py``
which keeps serving the provider card (model pick, pull, runtime). Every
handler sits behind the same capability gate as the pull routes —
:func:`provider_routes._require_pull_capable` — so a cloud card answers 400
with a sentence, never a silent empty table.

Response bodies are Pydantic models: the Python half of the five-layer
parity contract (AP-4); the TS mirror lives in ``src/hooks/useLocalModels.ts``.

Deleting is the one destructive action, and it is refused — 409 with the
reason — while a configured role still points at the model, unless the
caller names a replacement (``?reassign=``) that is installed; then the
roles are rewritten through the config writers FIRST, so a crash between
the two steps leaves a valid config, never an empty slot.
