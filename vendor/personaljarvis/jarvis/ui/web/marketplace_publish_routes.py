"""REST API for in-app marketplace publishing.

Endpoints:
    GET    /api/marketplace/publish/identity          — signed-in state (+enabled)
    POST   /api/marketplace/publish/signin/start      — begin GitHub device flow
    GET    /api/marketplace/publish/signin/poll/{id}  — poll until approved
    DELETE /api/marketplace/publish/identity          — sign out (drop token)
    POST   /api/marketplace/publish/validate          — field-level pre-check
    POST   /api/marketplace/publish/submit            — publish (opens the bot PR)
    POST   /api/marketplace/publish/submit-wallpaper  — publish a picker wallpaper
    GET    /api/marketplace/publish/status            — is name@version live in the feed

The heavy lifting lives in ``jarvis/marketplace/publish.py``; this layer only
shapes it for the view and the auto-generated CLI.
