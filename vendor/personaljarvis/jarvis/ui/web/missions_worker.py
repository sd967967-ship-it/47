"""Jarvis-Agent worker aggregator for the mission-detail API.

Phase 9 (Welle 4 UI): once the Jarvis-Agent harness is wired into the
mission-manager worker layer, it emits ``WorkerSpawned`` events with a
session_id and ``step["harness"] == "openclaw"`` (the harness-registration
slug — kept as-is for backward compatibility, see AliasChoices in
HarnessConfig). This aggregator pulls all Jarvis-Agent-specific UI fields
out of a mission's event stream —
``state_dir``, ``log_path``, ``reattach_status``, ``cost_usd``, ``tokens``.

Pure helpers, no IO. Tests for this live in
``tests/missions/api/test_missions_worker_aggregator.py``.

Contract compatibility (see ``docs/jarvis-agents-bridge.md``):
- ``MISSION_STATE_DIR`` convention from the worker-runtime builder (see
  ``jarvis/missions/workers/provider_chain.py``):
  ``<worktree>/.openclaw_state/<session_id>/openclaw_state`` (legacy
  directory-name segments, kept for on-disk backward compatibility).
- ``log_path`` convention: the worker writes ``run.log`` into state_dir
  (see the Welle-3 spike results §SP-4).
- Reattach status: ``live`` as long as neither ``WorkerKilled`` nor a
  mission-terminal event follows; otherwise ``ended``/``killed``.
