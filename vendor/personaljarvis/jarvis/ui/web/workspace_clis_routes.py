"""REST routes for the terminal CLIs the user added themselves.

The HTTP face of :mod:`jarvis.workspace.custom_clis`. Everything these routes
touch ends up in the same registry the shipped CLIs live in, so a CLI created
here is immediately offered by the setup wizard's terminal allocation, the
"open a terminal — what?" picker, the pane split menu and the voice catalog —
no restart, no second list to keep in step.

Mount alongside the other routers::

    from .workspace_clis_routes import router as workspace_clis_router
    app.include_router(workspace_clis_router)

**Why the write routes are marked dangerous.** A stored entry is a command line
this app will start in a terminal. That is exactly what the user is asking for
when they type it into the form themselves — and exactly what must not happen
because a model decided it would be helpful. The metadata keeps the generated
CLI and the tool broker asking first (CLAUDE.md §5, AP-14).
