    2026-08-26, four of nine connected rows were in one of those states, and
    the picker offered all nine as if they were equal.

    API / brain seats run the real one-token check the API-Keys screen's tab
    dots use (``provider_routes.provider_health``). A vendor CLI seat does
    not: it spends a subscription login, so this reports that login instead.
    The dual Claude row is why the split exists — its catalog id is
    ``claude-api``, and the API-Keys probe would otherwise paint "Key
    rejected" on a Claude Code seat that is signed in.

    Nothing waits for this: the composer paints from the catalog and folds
    these in when they land. A row that does not finish inside the sweep
