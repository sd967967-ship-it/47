"""REST API for the desktop shell's window management (detachable views).

A view can be split off into its own native desktop window ("detached solo
window") — initially the Agentic IDE and the Voice/Chats surface. The window
itself is created by the desktop shell (pywebview) because ``window.open`` is
silently dropped inside WebView2; the frontend calls these routes only when it
detects the embedded shell and falls back to a plain browser tab elsewhere.

Endpoints:
    POST /api/window/detach   {view}  → open (or focus) the detached window
    GET  /api/window/detached         → registry snapshot for mount-time resync
    POST /api/window/reattach {view}  → close the detached window

Dispatch follows the ``app.state.desktop_app`` pattern (see
``settings_routes.py::open_external``): when no desktop shell is attached —
headless server, Docker, degraded Linux desktop — the answer is an honest
``{"ok": false, "reason": "no_desktop_shell", "fallback_url": ...}`` so the
caller can open the solo URL in a real browser tab instead. Every pywebview
call is thread-hopped off the event loop: window methods block the calling
thread while the GUI thread services them (the 2026-08-06 realtime stall), and
pywebview only materializes runtime windows from a non-MainThread thread.

Wired into the WebServer in ``server.py::_build_app`` via
    from .desktop_routes import router as desktop_router
    app.include_router(desktop_router)
