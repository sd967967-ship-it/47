"""The desktop wallpapers: the generated library, plus the owner's own uploads.

Two stores live here, deliberately kept apart on disk:

* The generated library — five hundred pieces of *content* under
  ``data/jarvis-wallpaper-gallery`` (see below).
* Uploads — the pictures the owner brought themselves, under
  ``data/jarvis-wallpaper-uploads``. Regenerating or deleting the library must
  never touch somebody's own photograph, which is the one thing here that
  cannot be produced again.

The 500 generated wallpapers are *content*, not source. They live in a
git-ignored directory and are served from there instead of being copied into
the frontend's ``public/`` folder: 147 MB of artwork in the repository would be
paid for by every clone, every build, and every packaged desktop app, including
the ones whose owner never opens the picker.

Two consequences shape this module:

* The library is *optional*. A checkout without it is normal, not broken, so
  the catalog endpoint answers ``available: false`` and the app keeps its
  bundled default wallpaper. Nothing here raises on a missing directory.
* The browse grid must never pull full-size art. Every wallpaper is 1920x1080
  and averages 300 KB; five hundred of those is a 147 MB scroll. Thumbnails are
  derived once, cached on disk, and are what the grid actually requests — the
  full image is downloaded only when a visitor previews or applies one.
