"""FastAPI routes for the first-time onboarding guide.

All reads fail open (never 5xx): a missing/corrupt state file or a failing
first-run probe reports a safe "incomplete" default so the UI gate can decide
its own behaviour. There is NO server-side wake-word trademark rejection —
the legal posture rests on the accepted Terms + the wake-word acknowledgment,
not on blocking.
