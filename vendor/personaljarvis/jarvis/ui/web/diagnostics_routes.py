"""Event-loop diagnostics — snapshot every asyncio task with its await stack.

Built to hunt the AP-20-class busy-loop where anyio's
``CancelScope._deliver_cancellation`` reschedules itself on every event-loop
iteration because some task inside the cancelled scope never finishes
(measured 2026-07-10/11: ~95 % of one core burned while the app idles).
py-spy cannot name the owner — the sampled stack only shows the event-loop
callback, and an elevated process denies attachment anyway — so the app
reports on itself from inside the loop.

Read-only, stdlib-only, and imported lazily by ``server.py`` like every other
route module (AP-26: nothing here runs at boot; the handler only does work
when called).
