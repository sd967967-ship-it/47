"""The desktop window's last line of defence: never stay blank in silence.

``frontend/index.html`` already carries a watchdog, and it handles the case it
was written for — the page loaded, then the app above it died. It cannot handle
the case below it: a window in which **no page ever arrived**. Then there is no
script to run, no ``#root`` to write into, and no splash. What the user gets is
the native frame filled with the theme's ground colour, a title bar, and no way
back except killing the app (maintainer screenshots 2026-08-18 → 2026-08-20).

That state is reachable without anything being permanently broken, which is why
it kept coming back:

* **The server accepted but did not answer.** The whole backend — HTTP included
  — runs on one asyncio loop. Any synchronous call on that loop freezes the
  server without closing the socket, so the navigation gets no bytes and no
  error either; WebView2 keeps waiting and paints nothing. Measured on the
  maintainer's box the same day: 15 s, 20 s, 42 s, 61 s and 188 s of loop
  blockage, the long ones inside PortAudio's ``Pa_CloseStream`` during a
  microphone restart. ``_wait_for_backend`` had seen a healthy ``/api/health``
  moments earlier, so the window was already open when the freeze began.
* **The backend thread died after the port was up.** On 2026-08-20 13:45 an
  ``import uvicorn`` lost its ``click`` dependency mid-boot; the thread died and
  the window kept its ground colour for the rest of the process.
* **The web view itself never navigated** — a broken profile, a backend that
  could not start.

So the watchdog goes where it still runs in all three: the window process,
outside the loop it is watching. It asks the window what it is showing, waits
out a slow boot, reloads when the server comes back, and — when it cannot fix
it — puts the reason ON the window with a button, in the user's language. The
window heals itself first and explains itself second; a dark rectangle with no
words is the actual bug, whatever caused it.

The policy is a pure state machine (:class:`BlankWindowPolicy`) so every branch
is unit-testable without pywebview, a browser, or a clock.
