    The Start-Menu entry alone is not enough on a real machine. Windows excludes
    ``%LOCALAPPDATA%``/``%APPDATA%`` from the content index by default, and the
    per-user Start Menu lives inside ``%APPDATA%`` — so on a box whose index
    lacks the Start-Menu exception rule, NOTHING there is searchable and typing
    the app's name finds nothing at all. The Desktop is indexed, which is why
    Discord and Obsidian were still findable on the machine that reported this
    (forensic 2026-08-16: their Desktop .lnk files were in the index; the
    Start-Menu folder had zero entries).

    So this is not decoration — for that user it is the only working search
    entry, and the icon they expected to see. Everything else (target, icon,
    AUMID) is identical to the Start-Menu entry via ``_write_branded_shortcut``.

    ``create_if_missing=False`` repairs an existing shortcut but never
    resurrects a deleted one — a user who threw the icon away keeps their empty
    desktop. The installer passes ``True``; incidental callers should not.

    A frozen build writes nothing — see :func:`ensure_start_menu_shortcut`; the
    native installer owns the Desktop icon too, including the user's choice not
    to have one.

    Tkinter registers its window class *without* a class-icon slot, so a

    process icon: on Windows the taskbar/titlebar falls back to
    ``pythonw.exe`` → the blue/yellow Python logo, on Linux to the generic
    ``python3`` interpreter icon. Both are the same "shows Python, not Jarvis"
    symptom (BUG #UI-Pin-2026-05-05). Any Tk surface — the JarvisBar, the orb,
    any future Tk dialog — must call this once, right after creating its root,
    or it will visibly regress to the Python logo.

    Two OS-specific paths, because the toolkits read different surfaces:

    **Windows** — the taskbar renders the window *class* icon, and the
    highest-fidelity source is the multi-resolution ``jarvis.ico``:

      1. ``ensure_windows_app_identity`` — group this process under the Jarvis
         taskbar button (idempotent across processes).
      2. ``iconbitmap(default=.ico)`` — Tk-level icon for all toplevels.
      3. ``WM_SETICON`` + ``SetClassLongPtrW`` — the Win32 class-icon override,
         the only surface the taskbar actually reads.

    ``iconphoto`` (the PNG path) is deliberately NOT used on Windows: Tk
    re-asserts a ``PhotoImage``-derived class icon on later map/update cycles,
    which races and overwrites our ``SetClassLongPtrW`` — the live window ended
    up with a blank/greyed class icon. The ``.ico`` + Win32 path is the proven
    one (BUG #UI-Pin-2026-05-05).

    **Linux / macOS** — Tk exposes no class-icon slot to Win32, but its portable
    ``root.iconphoto`` sets ``_NET_WM_ICON``, which is exactly what the
    dock/taskbar reads. It needs a PNG (most Linux desktops and Tk cannot decode
    a Windows ``.ico``). The ``PhotoImage`` is stashed on the root because Tk
    keeps no reference — without it Python garbage-collects the image and the
    icon silently reverts to the generic ``python3`` interpreter icon.

    Every step is wrapped: the bar/orb are cosmetic and must never crash — or
    block their Tk mainloop — on an icon hiccup. Must run on the Tk thread that
    owns ``root`` (``winfo_id`` / ``PhotoImage`` are thread-affine).
