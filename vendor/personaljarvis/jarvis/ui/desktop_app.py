# Conductor is a standalone OSS package that must never import ``jarvis``, so
# it cannot reach the EventBus itself. It hands out structured facts through
# the ``on_event`` callback its Runner has always had; THIS side turns them
# into a sentence and publishes it — the same seam every other embedded
# component uses to get the bus.
#
# Division of labour: Conductor decides WHETHER a finished run is news
# (``conductor.core.notify`` — state changes only, never every-run chatter);
# Jarvis decides WHAT IS SAID and in WHICH LANGUAGE, so no locale is ever
# baked into the standalone package.

#: One plain sentence per news kind and locale. No job ids, no exit codes, no
#: stack traces — the user hears the outcome; the technical reason rides along
#: in ``AnnouncementRequested.detail``, which the transcript shows and the
#: voice never speaks. Runtime voice output is the closed product surface, so
#: these strings stay localized (CLAUDE.md §1).

        ``prebound`` (fast-boot launcher path): ``(loop, bootstrap)`` already
        created + bound BEFORE this heavy module was imported, so the port-bind
        beat the import floor. When ``None`` (classic path), this creates the
        loop and binds the bootstrap itself.

        Creates a dedicated asyncio loop, starts the ``WebServer``
        (``await server.start()``), and keeps the loop running forever
        until ``stop()`` is passed through via :meth:`shutdown`.

        This is also where the Phase-1a core objects get wired up:
        ``Supervisor`` + ``ChatStore`` + ``BrainManager`` (with MockBrain as
        a fallback). They hang off ``server.app.state`` and are activated
        via an event subscriber on ``MessageSent(role="user")``, so chat
        works end-to-end without polling.

        Since 2026-04-21: text chat uses the same BrainManager as the voice
        pipeline (shared bus + shared history). The default provider is
        ``gemini`` from ``jarvis.toml`` — this sidesteps the 429 problem of
        direct OAuth API calls.

        Since 2026-04-25: NO MORE MockBrain fallback in the chat path. If
        ``build_default_brain()`` fails, ``brain`` stays ``None`` and chat
        replies with an honest setup instruction instead of scripted
        canned phrases. User request: no "dumb Jarvis" without an LLM.
