"""The app's colour theme, as the NATIVE layer needs it.

The web UI resolves its own theme from CSS custom properties
(``frontend/src/index.css``). This module exists for the surfaces that are
painted before — or entirely outside — that stylesheet:

* the pywebview window background, drawn while the web view is still empty
  (``jarvis/ui/shell/window.py``, ``jarvis/ui/desktop_app.py``);
* the "backend is still starting" holding page served by the web server
  (``jarvis/ui/web/server.py``), which has no bundle to fall back on.

Both used to hardcode ``#0a0e14``, which meant a user on the light theme spent
the whole boot looking at a black frame around a paper-white app. The two
grounds here are kept in lockstep with the boot splash in ``frontend/index.html``
and with ``--background`` in ``index.css``.

``system`` is resolved per OS behind a capability probe. Every probe is allowed
to fail: an unreadable registry, a missing ``defaults`` binary, a headless box
with no desktop session at all — all of them degrade to the product default
(dark) rather than raising, because a colour is never worth failing a boot over.
