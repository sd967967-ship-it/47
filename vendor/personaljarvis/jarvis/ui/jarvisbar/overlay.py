"""JarvisBarOverlay — the slim Tk on-screen bar.

Implements the same duck-typed surface API ``OrbBusBridge`` already drives, so
the bridge is reused unchanged. ``show(mode)`` selects the renderer state;
``set_level`` writes ``_ext_level`` directly (an atomic float assignment, like
the orb). Text/mouth methods are deliberate no-ops — the bar shows no text.

Signals:
- LISTENING: the speech capture path publishes input RMS via ``mic_level``;
  ``OrbBusBridge`` forwards it to this surface without opening a second mic.
- SPEAKING: the audio player publishes its output RMS via ``level_tap``, which
  this surface subscribes to on ``start()``.
- THINKING: the renderer sweeps a highlight along the row (no external signal).

Threading mirrors the orb: a daemon thread runs the Tk mainloop; all Tk
mutations from the bus-subscriber thread go through ``_enqueue_ui`` → a queue
drained on the Tk thread. ``set_level`` is the sole exception (atomic write).

No ``SetWindowLong`` is ever called directly, but ``-topmost`` IS re-asserted
on every reveal (``_do_show``), and Windows can silently drop the layered
color-key/alpha on that kind of style mutation (BUG-030). A reveal therefore
maps at zero opacity, composes the prepared canvas, and only then restores the
configured opacity. This keeps Tk's opaque backing surface off-screen even
when the bar spent long enough withdrawn for the idle renderer to stop
repainting.

# Frame pacing (BUG: "JarvisBar stutters" forensic, 2026-07-10). A 41s GIF
# capture frame-diffed to only ~5 visual updates/second on average, in a
# burst-then-freeze pattern (freezes up to 1.25s). Measured root causes, on
# this machine:
#
# 1. The bar's window style itself (frameless + ``-topmost`` + a color-key
#    ``-transparentcolor`` + a translucent ``-alpha``) is a Windows *layered*
#    window; every ``ImageTk.PhotoImage``/``itemconfig`` swap makes DWM
#    recomposite it. A benchmark that swaps a CONSTANT-COLOR image on an
#    identically-styled window (zero render work) still only reached ~31
#    updates/s against an ``after(16)`` (60fps) schedule — a ~15ms fixed
#    per-tick compositing tax, independent of what gets drawn. So the 60fps
#    target was already unreachable on this window style even at zero cost.
#    The idle pill draws NOTHING beyond its at-rest background (see
#    ``renderer.render``'s idle branch), so idle-at-rest frames are paying
#    that compositing tax for a BYTE-IDENTICAL image every single tick — pure
#    waste. ``_IDLE_SETTLE_TICKS`` below skips the render/PhotoImage/
#    itemconfig work once the resting pill has visibly settled.
# 2. A background thread holding the GIL (simulating wake-poll/other Python
#    work sharing this process) collapsed the SAME loop to ~4-5 renders/s
#    with 250-360ms gaps — matching the GIF's freeze pattern. This is GIL/CPU
#    contention from OTHER threads in the process; no delay-scheduling choice
#    made here can prevent it (a Windows thread-priority raise for the Tk
#    thread was benchmarked too and showed no measurable improvement against
#    pure GIL contention, so it is deliberately NOT used). What this loop CAN
#    do is shrink its own contribution to that contention — the idle-skip
#    above is the main lever, and adaptive pacing (below) prevents an
#    occasional slow render (measured up to ~30ms in "think"+hovered mode,
#    back when thinking drew a supersampled orbital core; the travelling
#    sweep that replaced it costs the same as the equalizer — 3.2x less than
#    the core, measured 2026-08-20 — so the pacing now has far less to
#    absorb, but the states it protects are unchanged) from compounding into
#    an even longer visible gap.
#
# Idle-static skip: EVERY branch renderer.render() can reach while the coarse
# mode is "idle" is time-independent (the empty resting pill, the hovered
# idle pill's static mic glyph, the muted idle pill's static mic glyph — the
# equalizer bars and the close-X both require an active/listen/speak/think
# mode, never reached while idle). So once the resting pill's eased size has
# stopped changing (ease() with factor 0.5 converges to sub-pixel precision
# within a handful of ticks; 30 is a generous margin) for a given
# (hover, mute) combination, every further tick would repaint the exact same
# pixels regardless of hover/mute. Skipped ticks still stamp the heartbeat
# and re-arm the loop, so the watchdog/self-healing contract is untouched —
# only the render()/PhotoImage()/itemconfig() work is skipped.
_IDLE_SETTLE_TICKS = 30

# Silent-active skip (CPU diet, 2026-08-22): the equalizer is deterministic in
# (t, level) and ``bar_heights`` collapses to a flat row of ``min_h`` strokes
# the moment the level is zero — so a ``listen``/``speak`` bar with no sound
# (the wake listener waiting, which is the bar's state for HOURS) repaints the
# same pixels every tick just like the idle pill does. Those ticks go through
# the same settle counter: once the eased pill size and display level have
# converged, the render/PhotoImage/itemconfig work is skipped until sound,
# playback, a mode flip, hover or mute changes the tick key. Measured before
# the change: the tk thread alone cost ~6 % of one core while nothing was
# happening. ``think`` (the travelling sweep) and drop feedback stay
# time-dependent and are never skipped.

# Adaptive pacing: the nominal target is 40ms (25fps). The bar is a row of
# five strokes and a sweep — 25 updates/s is visually indistinguishable from
# the earlier 16ms target on this window style (whose measured DWM ceiling was
# ~31 updates/s anyway, see above) and costs a little over a third of the
# wake-ups. The actual next delay is derived from how long THIS tick took, not
# a blind constant. In the common case (render cost << target) this is
# indistinguishable from a fixed delay. It only matters after an unusually
# slow tick, where it schedules the next one sooner instead of adding a full
# target interval on top of the overrun — this bounds how much a single slow
# frame can widen the gap to the next one.
