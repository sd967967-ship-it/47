"""Pure rendering math + drawing for the whisper bar.

No tkinter, no I/O — every function is deterministic given its inputs, so the
visual behaviour is unit-testable. ``JarvisBarRenderer.render`` returns a PIL
image with a magenta color-key background that the Tk surface keys out.

State → look:
- ``idle``   → muted grey dots in a collapsed pill
- ``listen`` → gold equalizer bars, height driven by the live mic level
- ``speak``  → gold equalizer bars, height driven by the live TTS level
- ``think``  → the SWEEP: the same row of strokes, with one soft highlight
               travelling along it (synthetic, ignores level). It is the
               mission deck header bar's "working" look, brought over here so
               the two bars read as one product.
- ``dictate``              → the equalizer, driven by the dictation mic level.
- ``dictate_transcribing`` → the sweep: recording has stopped and the
               transcription is running, so there IS something to represent.
- ``notice``  → a breathing red cross in an opened pill: something the user
               asked for did not happen. The bar carries no text, so this look
               IS the message on this surface.

Gold only appears during activity; idle dots stay muted.

    matching 'bigger only while in the conversation'.

    Muted standby is the exception: instead of collapsing to the tiny empty
    pill (where the red rim is a hairline and the mic glyph is hidden), the
    muted bar stays at the OPEN size so the slashed-mic + red rim stay visible.
    A muted user is otherwise trapped — they can't unmute by voice (Jarvis is
    deaf while muted), so the click target must always be on screen.

    ``drop_open`` opens the pill for the same reason during a drag-drop: the
    resting pill is ~37x6 px on a 1440p monitor (and ~22x4 at the smallest "Bar
    size"), which is both a punishing target to release a file on and far too
    small to render a legible tick in. Opening on the first drag-enter turns
    the sliver into a real landing zone and gives the confirmation room to
    show.

    The dictation modes are ACTIVE too. Callers pass either the EFFECTIVE mode
    (``render``, where a dictation mode has already resolved to ``speak`` /
    ``think``) or the COARSE mode (the Qt surface's hover-footprint probe) — so
    listing them keeps the hit-box the user can hover in step with the pill the
    renderer actually draws during a dictation.

    ``notice`` opens the pill for the same reason a drop verdict does, and no
    further: the resting pill is a ~37x6 px sliver with no room to draw a
    legible mark in, while the 2x ACTIVE size would make a passing message look
    like a live session. OPEN is the size at which the answer is readable and
    still unmistakably not a conversation.

    ``prompt_mode`` opens the resting pill the way muted does, and for the
    same reason: the switch that rewrites every dictation is a state the user
    must be able to see at a glance, and the sparkle that shows it (and turns
    it off) needs the OPEN pill's room to be legible and clickable."""

    """Derive the rendered look from the coarse mode + actual audio activity.

    The bar's look is driven by ACTUAL audio, not by the supervisor state: the
    supervisor flips LISTENING/THINKING/SPEAKING in ways that don't line up with
    when sound is audible (TTS synthesis is silent for 0.5–20 s after the
    SPEAKING transition; continue-listening flips back to LISTENING mid-playback
    while Jarvis is still talking). So:

    The sweep (the animated "indicator") belongs ONLY to active thinking.
    Three distinct looks:

    - ``idle`` → ``idle`` (the standby pill). Silence here is not "thinking".
    - Real sound — ``playback_active`` (TTS audio on the device right now) OR a
      recent level within ``hold_s`` (your live mic) → the equalizer (``"speak"``
      → bars that move with the sound). ``playback_active`` is the player's
      authoritative signal, needed because the level tap only fires at
      buffer-write time (a brief instant per sentence) while the player then
      blocks for the whole multi-second playback with no further level.
    - Silent + ``coarse_mode == "think"`` (the THINKING state, and the silent
      TTS-synthesis lead-in which the bridge also shows as ``"think"``) → the
      sweep. This is the only place an indicator animates.
    - Silent + any OTHER active state (``"listen"`` — waiting after "Hey Jarvis"
      with no speech) → ``"speak"`` too, but with no level the equalizer renders
      flat and STILL: bars that just stand there, no indicator. "When nothing
      happens, nothing happens."

    ``hold_s`` bridges the short gaps between words/sentences so the bars don't
    flap back on every micro-pause.

    Dictation runs outside the voice state machine entirely and has two modes
    of its own, both resolved BEFORE the audio-activity branches so neither can
    be overruled by a stale level sample:

    - ``dictate`` (the user is speaking into the dictation mic) always renders
      as the equalizer. A SPEAKING dictation must never show the sweep:
      the mic level is being fed, so a silent pause mid-sentence shows still
      bars rather than falling through and pretending to think.
    - ``dictate_transcribing`` (the key was released, the transcription is
      running) renders as the sweep. Here there genuinely IS work in
      flight to represent, and the mic feed has stopped — showing the equalizer
      would claim the bar is still listening when it is not.

    ``notice`` is resolved first and passes through unchanged. It is the one
    look that must survive EVERY other signal: it is raised precisely when
    something did not happen, and a stale level sample or an in-flight playback
    must never be able to repaint it as listening or speaking — that would
    replace the answer to the user's key press with a lie about the microphone.
