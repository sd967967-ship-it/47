"""Out-of-process Jarvis Bar surface — the macOS hosting fix (BUG-057).

``SubprocessBarOverlay`` implements the duck-typed surface API
``OrbBusBridge`` drives, but renders nothing itself: it spawns
``python -m jarvis.ui.jarvisbar.host`` — whose MAIN thread may legally own
Aqua-Tk — and forwards every surface call as one JSON line on the child's
stdin. Child events (talk, hang-up, mute toggle, feedback, show-window, drop)
stream back on stdout. Voice actions are executed against the live
parent-process pipeline; bridge-owned actions are dispatched to its registered
callbacks. A forwarded drop is replayed onto THIS process's drop bridge (the
brain lives here, not in the host) and its verdict is sent back down so the
hosted bar can confirm the drop on screen.

Failure contract: while the host is down, every method degrades to a one-log
no-op (``NullOverlay`` behavior) — the bar is cosmetic and must never take
the app down with it. Revised 2026-07-18: a live Mac test hit a host death
mid-session and the bar stayed hidden for the rest of it, so a dead host now
gets a BOUNDED auto-respawn — up to ``_RESPAWN_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` attempts per
``SubprocessBarOverlay`` instance lifetime, each preceded by a
``_RESPAWN_BACKOFF_SECONDS`` non-blocking backoff (scheduled on its own
daemon thread, never the caller's) — after which the last known
visibility/mode/mute/level state is re-applied so the bar comes back looking
right instead of blank. Once every attempt is spent the bar reverts to the
original contract: it stays hidden until the next overlay swap or app
restart. Deliberately defines no ``_root`` attribute so the bridge's reset
path early-returns (same contract as ``NullOverlay``).
