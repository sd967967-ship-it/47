"""Sessions in flight: who is running, who is listening, who is waiting.

:class:`AgentChatService` is the one object the routes talk to. It owns the
store, keeps at most ONE running turn per session, fans every event out to
the session's live subscribers (the WebSocket handlers) after persisting it,
and parks a turn on an ``asyncio.Future`` while the person decides on an
approval card. Cancel sets the turn's event and awaits the task; a runner
that is mid-tool or mid-stream ends at the next boundary (the API loop
between deltas, the CLI by killing the child).

The runner is picked per turn from the provider row AND the session's
surface. On the agent surface a CLI-backed provider uses :mod:`runner_cli`,
``claude-api`` uses the CLI when the ``claude`` binary is on PATH and the API
otherwise, and everything else uses :mod:`runner_api`. On the Jarvis surface
(the front page's chat) every API-key or local row runs on Jarvis' own brain
instead (``brain``), and a CLI seat runs as Jarvis. The choice is recorded in
``turn_started`` so the timeline can say what answered.

        reopening the chat after talking showed nothing of it. This writes the
        turn's two texts as ordinary timeline events (``user_message`` plus a
        finished voice turn), so the chat reads the same whether a turn was
        spoken or typed, and the next typed turn sees the spoken words in its

        session that is busy typing keeps running — the imported turn simply
        lands after it. ``runner`` is ``"voice"`` so a later reader can tell
