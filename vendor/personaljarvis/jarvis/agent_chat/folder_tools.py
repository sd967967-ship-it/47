"""The chat's folder tools as Jarvis tools — one safety path, not two.

The typed chat has a working folder (the composer's folder chip), and in it
Jarvis gets hands a voice turn does not have: ``Read`` / ``Write`` / ``Edit``
/ ``Ls`` / ``Glob`` / ``Grep`` / ``RunCommand``, the file and shell tools of
:mod:`jarvis.agent_chat.tools`, scoped to that folder. On the Jarvis surface
they are not run by a private loop with its own approval card (the API
runner's way); they are wrapped as :class:`jarvis.core.protocols.Tool`
objects and merged into the brain turn's tool surface, so every call goes
through ``ToolExecutor`` like any other Jarvis tool — risk tiers, blacklist,
whitelist, the audit log and the approval workflow apply exactly as they do
on the voice path (AP-3: only the executor is authorized).

Tiers: the read-only four are ``safe``; ``Write``, ``Edit`` and
``RunCommand`` are ``ask``. What "ask" means for a given chat is decided by
its permission stance in :mod:`jarvis.agent_chat.approval_bridge` (an
``accept-edits`` chat waves ``Write``/``Edit`` through, a ``bypass`` chat
everything, an ``ask`` chat shows the card). The ``[safety.blacklist]``
patterns match ``"RunCommand <command>"`` and the bare command, so the
shipped blacklist protects the chat shell too — in every stance.

Names stay CamelCase, as the coding agents spell them: they do not collide
with any Jarvis tool (the router's set is hyphenated and lower-case), and
the tool-use loop resolves exact names first.
