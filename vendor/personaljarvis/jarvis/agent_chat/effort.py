"""Reasoning-effort levels per agent-chat provider.

Every provider exposes its own ladder: Claude Code takes ``--effort low |
medium | high | xhigh | max``, the Codex CLI ``low .. ultra`` (per model), the
OpenAI API ``none .. max`` (per model), Gemini 3 has three ``thinking_level``
steps, Antigravity's ``agy`` takes ``low | medium | high`` (per model, none
on its Claude models). The picker in the
composer shows exactly the ladder of the provider in use, and
:func:`normalize_effort` folds a picked level onto the nearest one a provider
accepts when the two disagree (a session that moves from Codex to Gemini
keeps "high"; "xhigh" becomes Gemini's "high").

Single source of truth: the frontend receives these lists through
``GET /api/agent-chat/catalog`` and never mirrors them (AP-4).
