"""What a chat surface brings to a turn: the runner, the ladder, the hands.

A *surface* is one place a person types to Jarvis: the front page (``jarvis``)
and the Agentic IDE's chat mode (``agent``). They share the session store, the
WebSocket stream and the approval card; they differ in what answers and with
which tools. Before this module those differences were ``if surface == "jarvis"``
branches in four files. Now each surface is one :class:`SurfaceKit` here and
the four call sites do one lookup each — a new surface is a new kit, not four
new branches.

Import-light: the kit builders import their tool modules lazily so this file
costs nothing at boot (AP-26).
