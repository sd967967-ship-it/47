"""Permission modes per agent-chat runner.

Every runner has its own idea of "how much may the agent do without asking":
Claude Code has ``--permission-mode`` (default / acceptEdits / plan /
bypassPermissions / dontAsk), the Codex CLI pairs a sandbox with an approval
policy (the TUI's Read-only / Auto / Full-access presets, plus headless
``--approve-for-me`` where its own reviewer model answers the prompts),
Antigravity's ``agy`` knows accept-edits, plan and a skip-permissions
switch, OpenCode's ``run`` has its own rules plus ``--auto`` and a read-only
plan agent, Kimi's print mode is autonomous by design, the DeepSeek harness
keeps its policy in its own settings, and the in-process API runner gates
its own tools. The composer
shows exactly the ladder of the runner in use — the same words the vendor's
own CLI uses, so a person who knows Claude Code's "Auto-accept edits" finds
it here — and
:func:`normalize_permission` folds a mode onto the nearest one another runner
offers when a session moves between providers.

``plan`` is special: every ladder that has it maps it onto "read and plan,
change nothing" (Claude Code's plan mode; a read-only sandbox on Codex; the
read-only tool set on the API runner). The composer draws it as the
Build | Plan switch next to the permission pill.

The **Jarvis surface** (the front page's chat — Jarvis with a keyboard, see
``jarvis.agent_chat.store.SURFACES``) shows ONE ladder whatever answers:
``ask`` / ``accept-edits`` / ``bypass`` plus ``plan``, the three stances
Claude Code's own modes express, in Claude Code's words (maintainer,
2026-08-25). A CLI seat folds them onto its vendor spelling through
:func:`normalize_permission`; the brain runner reads them as stances (see
``jarvis.agent_chat.approval_bridge``). ``bypass`` never overrides the
blacklist — ``RiskTierEvaluator.evaluate`` raises for a blacklisted call
before any approval logic runs, in every stance.

Single source of truth: the frontend receives the ladders through
``GET /api/agent-chat/catalog`` and never mirrors them (AP-4).
