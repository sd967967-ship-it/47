"""The event vocabulary of an agent-chat session.

One shape for the persisted log and the live WebSocket stream: every event is
a plain dict ``{"seq", "ts_ms", "kind", "payload"}``. The UI rebuilds a
session's timeline by folding the persisted events, then keeps folding live
ones — the same reducer for both, so a reopened session looks exactly like
it did while it ran (``src/components/agentchat/reduce.ts``).

Kinds (``payload`` keys in brackets):

``agent_message``      [IncomingMessage fields] — trusted internal sender, initially queued
``agent_message_status`` [message_id, status, turn_id, error] — durable delivery receipt
``user_message``       [text]                          — the person's turn
``turn_started``       [turn_id, provider, model, effort, runner]
``text_delta``         [turn_id, message_id, text]     — live only, never stored
``assistant_text``     [turn_id, message_id, text]     — the finished block
``reasoning_started``  [turn_id, message_id]           — live only: the model began
                        to think (its thinking may be redacted, so this is the
                        only sign of it until the finished block arrives)
``reasoning_delta``    [turn_id, text]                 — live only
``reasoning``          [turn_id, text, duration_ms]    — the finished block; text
                        may be "" when the vendor redacts thinking — the
                        duration still says how long it thought
``usage_delta``        [turn_id, usage]                — live only: tokens so far
                        (cumulative {input_tokens, output_tokens, …})
``tool_call``          [turn_id, call_id, name, input]
``tool_result``        [turn_id, call_id, output, is_error, duration_ms]
``approval_required``  [turn_id, approval_id, call_id, name, input, summary]
``approval_resolved``  [turn_id, approval_id, decision]   decision: allow | deny
``turn_finished``      [turn_id, status, duration_ms, usage, error, cost_usd]
                        status: done | cancelled | error
``session_updated``    [title?, provider?, model?, effort?, cwd?, permission_mode?]
``error``              [turn_id?, message]
``notice``              [kind, ...]                      — a system line outside a turn

``text_delta`` / ``reasoning_delta`` / ``reasoning_started`` / ``usage_delta``
are the transient kinds: the finished block carries the whole text and the
``turn_finished`` event the whole usage, so the log never stores token dust.
