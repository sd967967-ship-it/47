"""``reveal-key-preview`` tool — speak a stored API key, masked.

Router-tier, ``monitor`` (runs without nagging, but every reveal is logged).
User mandate (2026-05-31): when the user asks "what is my Gemini key", the
assistant may say a MASKED preview — the first 3 and last 3 characters only,
e.g. ``AIz...xQ2`` — never the full key, in any language.

This is a deliberate, narrow exception to AP-2 (no secrets via voice/chat): the
tool reads the stored value via :func:`jarvis.brain.app_control.masked_secret_preview`,
which returns only 6 characters and never logs the full value. On a real API key
that leaves 30+ characters hidden, so the preview alone is useless to an attacker
(the GitHub/Stripe "last 4" pattern).

Refusing the FULL key is handled by this tool's own ``description`` below (a
reasoned, multilingual, non-canned refusal), which travels with the tool
wherever it is offered. It used to live in the router system prompt as well;
that copy was removed when the prompt was cut, because a rule stated next to
the tool reaches the model exactly when the tool does — and only then.
This tool simply has no way to return the full value.
