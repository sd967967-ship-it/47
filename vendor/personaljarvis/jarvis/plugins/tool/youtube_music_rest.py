"""youtube_music tool — play, steer and read the user's YouTube Music by voice.

Google publishes NO YouTube Music API. What it does publish, and what this
tool is built on, is the **YouTube Data API v3** — the catalog behind YouTube
Music is YouTube's catalog (a song is a video in category 10, an album is an
``OLAK5uy_…`` playlist, the user's playlists and likes are ordinary YouTube
playlists and ratings). Everything the community "YouTube Music APIs" add on top
is a reverse-engineered private client that breaks with each redesign and sits
outside YouTube's terms, so it stays out (AP-2 spirit: an official key-backed
path over a fragile scrape).

Three facts of that API shape everything below:

* **It produces no audio and offers no remote control.** There is no YouTube
  equivalent of Spotify Connect. Playing means opening a ``music.youtube.com``
  watch link in the user's browser — their own account, Premium and history —
  and steering means the OS media session (``jarvis.platform.media_session``),
  the same channel the keyboard's play/pause keys use. Reading "what is playing"
  comes from that session too, so it works for the browser tab, the installed
  YouTube Music app, and honestly names any other player that happens to be
  current.
* **Search is rationed.** Google gives every Cloud project 100 ``search.list``
  calls a day (its own bucket, separate from the 10,000-unit pool the other
  calls draw from), so each "play X" is one of them; results are cached per
  process and the day's exhaustion is reported as Google's limit, not a fault.
* **A "song" search hits videos.** The user's own playlists are matched by name
  first (a cheap ``playlists.list``), likes are read with ``videos.list
  myRating=like``, and every deep link is built so YouTube Music keeps going
  after the first track (a song opens as its own radio, ``list=RDAMVM<id>``).

Risk tier ``monitor``: starting music is audible and instantly reversible, and
the writes (like, add to playlist, create playlist) are all undoable in the app.
A direct gated action, never a spawn (AP-5/AP-14).
