"""``wiki-page-read`` tool — read a single page from the long-term Obsidian wiki.

B5 follow-up (post-merge).  Router-tier read-only tool.

Why a second wiki tool exists
-----------------------------
``wiki-recall`` returns up to 5 hits with a 240-character snippet each.
That is enough for "what do we know about X" but truncates anything
longer.  When the brain has already narrowed the answer down to one page
(e.g. user asks "read me everything about Joy") it needs the *full*
markdown content, not a snippet.  This tool fills that gap.

Placement rule
--------------
Router-visible. Jarvis-Agents may reach the live tool only through ADR-0025's
mission-scoped supervisor broker. Never include it in any ``SUB_TOOLS``
frozenset or direct worker tool set; the live vault object stays in the
supervisor.

Path-traversal safety
---------------------
The ``path`` argument is treated as **vault-relative**.  After joining
with ``vault_root`` we re-resolve the absolute path and assert it stays
inside ``vault_root``.  Anything outside (e.g. ``../../etc/passwd`` or
absolute paths) is rejected with ``"path outside vault"``.

Privacy rule (matches ``wiki-recall``):
    The requested path is logged at INFO; the page body is **never**
    logged.
