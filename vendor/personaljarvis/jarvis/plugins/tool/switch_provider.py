"""``switch-provider`` tool — change the active brain/TTS/STT/subagent provider.

Router-tier, ``monitor`` (runs immediately, audited — no up-front confirmation).
This is the voice/chat path for "switch the voice to Cartesia", "use Groq for
speech recognition", "put the subagent on codex", etc.

NOT the brain, though the ``tier`` schema still accepts it: a ``brain`` switch is
REFUSED here with ``provider_switch_locked`` and never reaches
``apply_provider_switch``. The active brain provider is the user's hard choice
and changes only through the control CLI or the desktop app's manual switch
(``actor=AuditActor.USER``) — see ``jarvis/core/self_mod/provider_lock.py`` and
``tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_switch_provider_brain_lock.py``. Jarvis itself,
which is what calls this tool, is exactly the actor the lock excludes.

A provider switch is REVERSIBLE and the tool speaks an honest post-change readback
(old -> new), so an STT mishear of the provider name is caught *after* the fact —
there is no need to block on an up-front yes/no, which would violate the
anti-confirmation-fatigue mandate. Forensic 2026-06-26: with ``ask`` a voice
"switch the subagent brain to antigravity" asked "really do that?" and the
two-turn voice-confirm flow then ended the session before the user could answer.
Irreversible actions (gmail send, place a call) stay ``ask``.

It switches *which provider is active* — it never sets a raw API key. The target
provider's key must already be stored (Settings tab / wizard); if it is missing
the tool returns a clean message instead of switching (AP-2: no secrets via
voice; the self-mod ``FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS`` doctrine).

Brain and TTS apply live (no restart); STT and subagent are wired once at
bootstrap and report ``requires_restart: true`` honestly (AD-OE6: no silent
drops). The actual switch reuses :mod:`jarvis.brain.app_control`, the same
3-layer persist + live-apply path the REST endpoints use.
