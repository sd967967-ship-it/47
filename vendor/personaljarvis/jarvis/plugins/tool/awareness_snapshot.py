"""``awareness-snapshot`` tool — synchronous state read for the router.

Binding per Plan §5: this tool is router-tier-only (NOT in SUB_TOOLS). It
makes NO brain call and NO IO — just a synchronous read on
``AwarenessState.snapshot_for_prompt()``.

When the main Jarvis uses it: for utterances like "what am I doing right
now?" or "which file am I in?" — the answer is already in the awareness
state and doesn't need an LLM roundtrip or a Jarvis-Agent spawn.
