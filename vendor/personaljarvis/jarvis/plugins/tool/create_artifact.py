"""``create_artifact`` — build (or revise) one self-contained page, when asked.

An artifact is the thing the user wants to LOOK AT: a dashboard, a report, an
infographic, a small interactive tool — one HTML file, rendered full-size in
the Artifacts section and openable in any browser. Writing such a page well
needs the strongest model the install has and more time than a voice turn can
hold, so this tool never writes the page itself. It composes the brief
(:mod:`jarvis.artifacts.brief`) and hands it to the mission stack — the same
sub-agent path ``spawn_worker`` uses — then returns within the voice budget
with a spoken promise. The worker writes the file into its worktree, the
Kontrollierer archives it as the run's deliverable, and the mission voice
listener reads the completion back; the Artifacts section shows the page the
moment it lands, because it reads the very archive the worker wrote into.

**Ask-only.** The tool is withheld from the model's tool set on any turn that
did not explicitly ask for an artifact; see :mod:`jarvis.brain.artifact_gate`
and ``BrainManager._hide_artifact_tool_without_request``. The gate is the real
enforcement — this description is the second line, for the turns where the
gate opens but the request was about something else.

Router-tier. It is a dispatch (risk ``monitor``, like ``spawn_worker``), so it
never enters a worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14): a worker building an artifact
cannot spawn another worker to build it.
