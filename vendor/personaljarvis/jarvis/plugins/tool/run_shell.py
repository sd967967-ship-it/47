"""run_shell tool: runs shell commands (via subprocess).

Risk tier: monitor — the safety layer decides via whitelist/blacklist whether
confirmation is needed. The whitelist/blacklist matching runs on the FULL
command string inside ``ToolExecutor`` before this tool executes, so it is
independent of how the string is executed below.

Shell choice (redesign 2026-08-08): the brain writes commands for the shell it
ASSUMES, so the tool must (a) run a shell the model expects and (b) declare
that shell in its description. Session forensics (2026-08-04/06/07) showed the
model emitting PowerShell (``Add-Type``, ``Start-Process``) and POSIX
(``head``) commands into the previous ``cmd.exe`` backend — roughly half of
all first attempts failed with "command not found" and only succeeded after a
blind reformulation retry.

- Windows: ``powershell.exe -EncodedCommand`` (Windows PowerShell 5.1, present
  on every supported Windows). Base64-encoding the script sidesteps the
  quoting bugs entirely (forensic 2026-07-13: ``shlex.split(posix=False)``
  kept surrounding quotes, so quoted payloads were echoed back as literals
  with exit 0). A wrapper propagates the native exit code, because
  ``powershell -Command``/-EncodedCommand`` otherwise reports 0 even when the
  last native command failed.
- macOS/Linux: ``/bin/sh -c`` so pipes, ``&&`` and redirects work — the
  historical no-shell exec could not run ``ls | grep foo`` at all. Safety is
  unaffected: pattern matching happens upstream on the raw string.

    The wrapper script exists for three reasons:
    - ``[Console]::OutputEncoding`` makes native tool output decode as UTF-8
      (guarded: under CREATE_NO_WINDOW there may be no console to configure).
    - PowerShell's process exit code is 0 even when the command inside failed
      (both for native commands and for cmdlet errors — verified by test),
      so failures must be surfaced explicitly: cmdlet errors become
      terminating via ``$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`` and are caught,
      native exit codes propagate via ``$LASTEXITCODE``. Otherwise a failing
      command reports success and sends the brain into the false-success
      retry loop documented in the module docstring.
    - Caught errors are written with ``[Console]::Error.WriteLine`` — raw
      text. Letting them reach PowerShell's own error stream would serialize
      them as CLIXML noise on stderr, which the brain cannot read.
      ``$ProgressPreference`` suppresses progress records for the same reason.
