"""``awareness-recall`` tool — BM25 full-text search across recent episodes.

Plan §7 (Awareness Phase A3, L3 Session Search). Originally specified as a
``SUB_TOOL`` for "Sub-Jarvis"; after Welle 4 deleted the sub tier entirely
this tool lives in ``ROUTER_TOOLS``. The router brain calls it directly
when the user asks about earlier work ("vorhin", "heute morgen", "an
welcher Datei war ich"), and may bake the result into an
``spawn_worker`` ``context_hints`` field if it then decides to delegate
heavy work to a Jarvis-Agent worker.

The tool is read-only (``risk_tier="safe"``): a single FTS5 ``MATCH``
query against the ``awareness_episodes_fts`` virtual table, no brain
call, no network, no mutation. Output is a compact markdown block that
the router brain can consume directly inside its system prompt — same
contract as ``awareness-snapshot`` so the brain does not need to learn a
new shape.
