"""``create-skill`` — the brain writes a NEW skill from the user's spoken description.

Why this tool exists (voice session 2026-08-18 17:51): the user asked, in
German, for a new "morning routine" skill — every morning at six read the new
mail, the Linear tickets and the day's calendar, then play an 80s classic on
YouTube Music.
The brain had NO way to write a skill — the only live authoring path was the
UI dialog (``POST /api/skills/creator/*``) and, indirectly, ``jarvisctl skills
draft`` + ``jarvisctl skills commit`` with JSON piped between them. The model
spent three tool rounds reading ``jarvisctl --help`` and the turn timed out.
The router tool documented as "deliberately unreachable" since 2026-07-25
(``jarvis/brain/tools/skill_authoring.py``) was unreachable because it needed
a worker runner the entry-point loader could not supply. This tool needs
nothing the loader cannot give: it resolves the live registry and the live
brain lazily at execute time (the wiki-ingest / spawn-worker resolver pattern).

What it does — ONE bounded call, no spawn:

1. builds the authoring context (attached tools + installed skills) so the
   generated steps name connectors that actually exist,
2. asks the brain ladder (active provider → Tool Model → quality → frontier)
   for a complete SKILL.md draft — name, description, voice trigger phrase,
   schedule cron when a time was named, numbered steps per tool, spoken answer
   format — via :class:`jarvis.skills.creator_service.SkillCreatorService`,
3. commits it as ``state: draft`` (AP-15 — never auto-active): the Skills view
   is where the user reads it and switches it on,
4. returns what was written so the answer can say it in one sentence.

It never writes a template with the sentence pasted in: when no brain could
author the draft, the result is an honest failure and nothing lands on disk
(``SkillCreatorUnavailable``). Direct gated action, monitor tier — an inactive
file in the user's skills folder, instantly deletable — never a spawn, so it
never enters a worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14).
