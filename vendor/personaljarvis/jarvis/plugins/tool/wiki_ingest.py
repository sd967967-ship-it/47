"""``wiki-ingest`` tool — explicit brain-driven wiki write path.

B5 follow-up (post-merge).  Router-tier tool with write semantics.

Why this tool exists alongside the voice-bridge
-----------------------------------------------
:class:`jarvis.memory.wiki.voice_bridge.VoiceFactBridge` already pushes
voice-spoken facts to the wiki via two heuristics: the *ack path* (brain
reply acknowledges a saved fact) and the *aggressive path*
(every user turn >= ``min_user_chars`` is curator-filtered).

Heuristics drift.  When the brain consciously decides "this is worth
storing" (e.g. user typed something into chat, or the brain is
summarising a long subagent run), it should be able to call a tool
explicitly instead of relying on the bridge picking it up.  That is what
this tool provides.

Architecture
------------
The tool delegates to the live :class:`~jarvis.memory.wiki.curator.WikiCurator`
instance owned by ``bootstrap_wiki_integration``.  The curator handles
salience filtering (an empty source returns zero updates, no harm done),
atomic writing with backup/rollback, and log-entry rendering.  This tool
adds nothing beyond the dispatch.

Risk tier and confirmation
--------------------------
Marked ``monitor``. The write surface is protected by ``AtomicWriter``
(AP-3 pre-validate, AP-4 backup) and the curator's salience filter; the
tool itself has no destructive scope.  Bypass-confirmation matches
``wiki-recall`` so the brain can call both freely.
