"""``run-skill`` tool: loads an installed skill's instructions for the brain.

Instruction-skill model (2026-06-09 rebuild, AD-S1/S2/S5 — see
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-09-skill-system-rebuild-design.md``):
the brain calls this tool when a user request matches one of the skills
listed in the AVAILABLE SKILLS section of the system prompt. The tool
resolves the skill in the process-wide ``SkillContext``, renders its body
(Jinja: ``config`` + time context + caller args), and returns the rendered
body as *instructions for the brain to follow with its own tools* — it
never macro-executes ``TOOL:`` lines itself.

Progressive disclosure:

* L1 — name + description live in the system prompt listing
  (``jarvis/skills/prompt_injection.py``).
* L2 — the full instruction body is returned by this tool on invocation.
* L3 — bundled files (``references/``, ``scripts/``, ``assets/``,
  ``agents/``) are served via the optional ``resource`` argument; nothing
  costs context until it is actually requested.

Design notes:

* ``SkillLifecycleState.DRAFT`` and ``DISABLED`` skills are rejected before
  anything renders (Plan-§AP-1/AP-15: constraint enforcement in code, not in
  prompt). DRAFTs may contain unsafe generated content — they must be
  promoted by the user first.
* ``risk_policy.default_tier == "block"`` is honoured immediately. The
  ``ask``-tier confirmation flow is intentionally NOT implemented here — the
  outer Tool-Use-Loop owns the general confirmation pipeline (see
  ``jarvis/safety/tool_executor.py``); a TODO marker keeps that boundary
  explicit.
* D9 recursion protection is unchanged and structural: this tool's output is
  *data* (instructions text). The brain follows the instructions through the
  normal router tool loop, which never exposes spawn tools to worker sets
  (AP-5). A skill body cannot re-enter a macro executor because none runs.
* ``execution: mission`` skills return a directive telling the router to
  dispatch ``spawn_worker`` with the instructions as the task brief (AD-S5);
  deterministic mission dispatch for *trigger-matched* turns lives in
  ``BrainManager`` — this tool only covers the model-decided path.
* A frozen ``SkillInvoked`` event (source="model") is published best-effort
  on every successful instruction load — the observability signal that
  answers "did a skill actually fire?" (AD-S6).
