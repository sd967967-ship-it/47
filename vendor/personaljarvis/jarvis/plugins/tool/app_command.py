"""Registry command tools — one flat tool per Command-Registry entry.

Virtual loader (the ``cli-tools`` pattern): the ``app-command`` entry point
expands into ONE tool per curated command in ``jarvis/commands/registry.py``
— ``brain-switch``, ``provider-test``, ``wake-word-set``, … — each with the
command's own flat JSON schema.

Why flat tools and not one umbrella tool with a nested ``command_id``+
``args`` interface: the umbrella design was tried first and failed live
(forensic 2026-07-11 11:38): the router LLM read the command list in the
umbrella's description and called ``provider-test`` AS A TOOL NAME —
"tool 'provider-test' not in the router tool set" — spoken error. Flash-class
routers handle many small flat schemas far better than one nested dispatch
schema, and the repo already loads CLI/MCP tools exactly this way.

Every tool still validates its arguments against the registry schema BEFORE
anything is sent, and executes through the SAME already-mounted REST endpoint
the desktop UI uses (in-process ASGI transport — full route validation, no
TCP). The readback is composed from the SERVER RESPONSE (echo-verify), never
from the model's intent. Dangerous registry commands carry risk tier ``ask``
(ToolExecutor two-turn voice confirmation); the rest run at ``monitor``.

Security: the registry contains no raw-secret writes (AP-2) and no spawn
commands (mission dispatch stays with spawn-worker, AP-5/AP-14). Only entries
with an explicit ``worker_allowed`` grant may enter a mission-scoped broker;
configuration mutation and dangerous commands remain supervisor-only.

    A ``default`` in a tool schema is a promise made to the model. It reads
    "compose — rewrite the instruction into a briefed task, default true",
    leaves the argument out because that is what a default is FOR, and expects
    the documented behaviour. Nothing kept that promise: the arguments went to
    the endpoint exactly as the model sent them, and the endpoint then applied
    ITS own default — which is chosen for the surface that calls it directly,
    not for the model reading the registry.

    Measured live 2026-07-27 18:47: ``agentic-ide-prompt`` declares
    ``compose: true`` while ``PromptRequest.compose`` defaults to False for the
    typed prompt bar, which sends what someone wrote by hand and must not have
    it rewritten. So every spoken instruction the router forwarded was typed
    into the coding agent verbatim — a one-line paraphrase where a briefed task
    with the workspace's files attached was the entire point of that path. The
