"""Alias resolution for local app launches.

Windows has two "find a program" mechanisms: the ``PATH`` (used by
``subprocess``) and the **App Paths registry**
(``HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\<exe>``) used
by the Win+R Run dialog and the shell ``start`` verb. GUI apps such as Chrome
register *only* in App Paths and are absent from ``PATH``; worse,
``os.startfile("chrome")`` performs a ShellExecute that silently does nothing
(no exception) when the bare name resolves to neither a file nor a verb.

That silent no-op was the root cause of "Jarvis says it opened Chrome but
nothing happens". The resolver therefore looks an app up in App Paths / PATH
*before* falling back to ``os.startfile``, handing the launcher an absolute,
verified executable so ``subprocess.Popen`` actually starts it (and raises a
real error when it can't).
