"""screenshot tool: captures the active monitor as JPEG for Brain vision.

Risk tier: monitor — a screenshot reads screen content, so calls are logged
by default. A whitelist entry under `[safety.whitelist].tools` allows
continuous use without a confirm prompt.

Phase A1 (2026-04-25): switched the default format to JPEG q85. Vision LLMs
(Claude/Gemini/GPT) charge token cost by pixel area, not bytes — JPEG
shrinks the payload by ~8x for identical tokens. Quality 85 is the
sweet spot: visually lossless for text + UI elements, noticeably smaller
than PNG. Iterative shrinking is no longer needed — the quality param
handles that.

Multi-monitor fix: by default the capture follows the foreground window
(``select_capture_monitor`` from ``jarvis.vision.screenshot``). That way
the brain sees the screen the user is actually active on — instead of
hardcoding the mss primary, which is often blank on multi-monitor setups.

Flow in `execute`:
1. Enumerate ``mss.mss().monitors`` -> ``select_capture_monitor`` picks
   the right monitor (foreground-window lookup).
2. `PIL.Image.frombytes("RGB", size, raw.rgb)` builds a Pillow image.
3. JPEG q85 — typically 100-300 KB for 4K screenshots. If it exceeds
   _MAX_BYTES (edge case on very detail-dense screens), quality is lowered
   until it fits.
4. Result: `artifacts=[{"type": "image", "mime": "image/jpeg", "data":
   <base64>}]` so the vision-capable brain can consume the screenshot
   directly.
