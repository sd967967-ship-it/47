"""SpawnWorkerTool — Delegation an die Jarvis-Agent-Bridge via Mission-Manager.

Welle-4-Migration: vorher ``SpawnSubJarvisTool`` mit eigenem
``SubJarvisManager``. Sub-Jarvis-Tier wurde durch Jarvis-Agent-Bridge ersetzt
(siehe docs/jarvis-agents-bridge.md §11). Das Tool dispatched jetzt eine Mission
an den ``MissionManager`` aus ``jarvis.missions.manager``; der Kontrollierer
+ Worker uebernehmen Worktree-Setup, Subprocess-Spawn (Jarvis-Agent-Bridge in
``jarvis/missions/worker_runtime/``) und Voice-Readback.

Das Router-Brain (Haiku/Flash) ruft dieses Tool, wenn der User eine komplexe
Aufgabe beschreibt (Code-Build, App-Entwicklung, mehrstufige Recherche).

Ablauf (Fire-and-Forget):
    1. ``JarvisAgentAnnouncement`` auf den Bus publishen fuer UI/Telemetry.
    2. ``MissionManager.dispatch(prompt=<utterance>, ...)`` Background-
       Task anstossen — Mission-Manager erzeugt PENDING-Mission, der
       Kontrollierer pickt sie auf und scheduled einen Worker.
    3. Tool-Call kehrt SOFORT mit leerem Output zurueck. Der Router-Brain
       ist sofort wieder frei fuer neue User-Utterances.
    4. Wenn die Mission im Hintergrund fertig ist, publisht der Voice-
       Listener (``jarvis/missions/voice/listener.py``) eine
       ``JarvisAgentBackgroundCompleted``-Nachricht auf den Bus, die die
       Speech-Pipeline in eine Voice-Ansage umwandelt.

Wichtig: Die User-Utterance wird **verbatim** weitergegeben (AC2). Die
``context_hints`` aus dem Router-Brainstorm bleiben in den Bus-Events fuer
UI/Telemetrie erhalten — der Mission-Decomposer nutzt sie nicht direkt
(er bekommt nur ``prompt``).

# into a minimal brief ("Erstelle ein sinnvolles HTML-Grundgerüst oder frage
# den User nach Details"), and the frontier Opus worker faithfully shipped a
# 12-line `Hallo Welt / Inhalt folgt` stub that passed the (structural-only)
# critic. The worker is not lazy — it executes the brief it is handed. This
# directive is the worker-side floor that overrides a lazy/minimal brief from
# the cheap router tier, independent of which backend (Claude / Gemini /
# Codex) runs the task: a stub is never an acceptable answer.

    "detail is unspecified, pick a rich, sensible default and build the "
    "finished artefact; never downgrade the task to a minimal version, and "
    'treat any hint (even one that says "Grundgerüst" / "skeleton") as a '
    "floor, not a ceiling. This raises the quality of exactly what was asked "
    "— it does not add unrequested features, and it never overrides an explicit "
    "constraint the user set on the SHAPE or scope of the deliverable (for "

    "a constraint is part of satisfying the request, not a downgrade. "
    # Form-constraint carve-out (2026-06-22, mission 019ef052): the "never
    # downgrade to a minimal version" floor read a single-file request as a
    # forbidden minimal version, so a "single HTML file" brief shipped four files
    # (html+js+css+asset). The floor governs QUALITY, never the user's chosen form.
    # Honest-impossibility escape (latency 2026-06-14): without this, the "never
    # downgrade / build the finished artefact" floor pushes the worker to spiral
    # on a task it cannot actually do (e.g. "book a trip" with no booking tool —
    # live mission 019ec708 ran 535s producing nothing). The floor applies to
    # the QUALITY of a doable task, never as a mandate to fake an undoable one.
    "If the task genuinely cannot be completed with the tools available to you "
    "(for example it requires a real-world action like booking, purchasing, "
    "sending, or signing into an external account for which you have no tool), "
    "do NOT simulate, partially attempt, or keep retrying it — state plainly and "
    "briefly that you cannot do it and why, then stop."

           Voice-Listener turns into a ``JarvisAgentBackgroundCompleted``
           event for TTS readback.

        Without step 2 the mission stays PENDING forever and the user
        gets no voice feedback (BUG-016). When no Kontrollierer is
        available the dispatch still happens — the next app start's

        promise, so the missing runner is published as a failed
        completion (AU-11) — the same event a finished mission uses,
        so the voice layer says it out loud instead of a log line
        nobody reads.
