"""search_web tool: key-free DuckDuckGo search, optional prepaid Apifare hop.

Risk tier: safe — read-only.

Weather path (live forensic 2026-06-10 23:12, data/jarvis_desktop.log):
"What's weather like tomorrow?" fired three DDG instant-answer calls that ALL
came back 202/empty — DDG has no weather data, the brain had nothing to say
and the turn died in the leak-recovery fallback. Weather-intent queries now
resolve via Open-Meteo (geocoding + forecast, key-free, no account) and return
a normal result snippet the brain phrases in the user's language. Any failure
(no location in the query, network error, unexpected payload) falls back to
the DDG path unchanged.
