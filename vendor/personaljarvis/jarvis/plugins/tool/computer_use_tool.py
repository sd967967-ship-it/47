"""``computer_use`` — router-tier tool for live-desktop control (Wave 1).

This is the first-class, clearly-described entry point the router brain uses to
drive the user's *actual* machine: open apps, click, type, scroll, drag — every
mouse-and-keyboard action. It exists because the router previously had no honest
path for desktop actions:

* ``spawn_worker`` runs a worker in an isolated git worktree — it can edit code
  and research, but it can **never** touch the user's live desktop.
* ``dispatch_to_harness`` could reach the computer-use harness, but only through
  a two-level indirection (``harness="computer-use"``) whose schema description
  talks about "generic sub-agent harnesses, code-editing, research" — so the model never
  picked it for desktop actions and instead refused or hallucinated a tool.

A dedicated tool with an unambiguous name + description is the strongest signal
for LLM tool selection. Execution is delegated to the canonical in-process
``computer-use`` harness (``jarvis/plugins/harness/computer_use.py`` →
``jarvis/harness/screenshot_only_loop.py``), which gates every individual action
through the ToolExecutor risk tiers (ADR-0008). The tool itself is a direct,
safe-gated action — never a spawn — so it carries no D9 recursion risk and never
belongs in a worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14).
