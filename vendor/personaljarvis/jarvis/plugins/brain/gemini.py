"""Google Gemini Brain with native and portable HTTP transports.

Gemini has its own functionCall format. We normalize to
`BrainDelta.tool_call = {id, name, input}`.

The native ``google-genai`` SDK remains the preferred transport because it
supports Gemini-specific features such as context caching. When that SDK or
one of its native/authentication dependencies cannot import, the provider
uses Google's official OpenAI-compatible HTTPS endpoint. The fallback keeps
core text, vision, streaming, and function-calling available on platforms
where the Google SDK dependency graph has no installable wheel.

    fails the WHOLE GenerateContent request, so the brain dies and the turn
    falls through the entire provider chain. This has now happened four times
    with a different key each time — OpenAI's ``strict``, Pydantic's ``$defs``,
    an MCP tool's ``propertyNames``, and the GitHub MCP server's

    know is dropped whatever it is called. A block-list can never be complete
    — any connected MCP server may ship any extension key it likes — and
