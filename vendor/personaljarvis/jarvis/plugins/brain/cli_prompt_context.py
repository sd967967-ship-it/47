Codex and Antigravity flatten a Jarvis turn into one plain prompt for an

that prompt is large, tool-heavy, and misleading for read-only conversational

equivalent and must still reach the answering model.

    Voice turns are flattened into a light conversational prompt on purpose,
    but background curation (the wiki extractor and Stage-2 judge) carries its
    own binding contract in ``req.system`` ("Return ONLY a JSON array ...").
    Replacing that contract with the conversational wrapper ("answer in one to
    three short sentences, plain text only") makes structured output
    impossible BY INSTRUCTION — the subscription CLI then looks permanently
    broken to the wiki provider chain (live 2026-07-18: every antigravity
    extraction died with "no JSON array found in response"). Structured mode
    forwards the system contract and the user payload verbatim instead.

    One line is added ahead of the contract, and it is not decoration. These
    CLIs are autonomous AGENTS, while a structured caller is addressing them as
    a model: given a payload full of file paths, the agent tries to go READ
    those files, headless mode cannot prompt for the permission, and the run is
    auto-denied. Measured live 2026-07-26 — an Agentic IDE brief came back as

        jetski: no output produced — a tool required the "read_file" permission
        that headless mode cannot prompt for, so it was auto-denied.

    A structured caller has already gathered everything the answer needs (the
    composer ships file outlines; the wiki extractor ships the text), so telling
    the agent to work from what it was given costs nothing and is what makes the
    difference between an answer and a permissions notice.
