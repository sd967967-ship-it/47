"""OpenAI Codex Brain — two backends, one provider.

Codex can back the conversational *brain* two ways:

* **API key** (``codex_openai_api_key`` / ``openai_api_key``): the fast, cheap
  path — a normal OpenAI chat-completions stream via ``_openai_base``.
* **ChatGPT login (OAuth)**: the explicit subscription voice profile uses the
  persistent ``codex app-server`` stable text protocol and streams assistant
  deltas. The ordinary Codex OAuth fallback retains ``codex exec`` for
  compatibility with the user's non-isolated CLI profile.

The CLI path runs ``codex exec`` in a throwaway temp dir with ``--sandbox
read-only`` (no writes, no dangerous commands), a light "answer conversationally"
prompt, and the OAuth env (drops ``OPENAI_API_KEY``/``CODEX_HOME`` so the global
``~/.codex/auth.json`` subscription token wins). It parses the ``agent_message``
JSON frame and yields it as the brain response.
