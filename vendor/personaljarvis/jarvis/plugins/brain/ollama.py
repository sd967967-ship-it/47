"""Ollama — keyless local brain via Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Runs whatever models the user has pulled into a local (or LAN) Ollama server —
no API key, no cloud account, nothing leaves the machine. The server's ``/v1``
endpoint speaks the OpenAI Chat-Completions format, so this brain is a thin
binding of the shared ``_openai_base`` streamer to the server root resolved
from ``[brain.providers.ollama].base_url`` / ``OLLAMA_HOST`` / the localhost
default — the same shape as the NVIDIA brain.

Keyless by design (§3 / AP-22): ``ollama`` is deliberately ABSENT from
``PROVIDER_SECRET_CANDIDATES`` — that absence is what makes the key-aware
resolver treat it as always reachable. A dead server fast-fails on the 2 s
connect timeout so the fallback chain crosses to the next family instead of
stalling. Tool calling rides the OpenAI-compat layer (``tool_choice`` is not
used on the pipeline path); reliability is model-dependent — the qwen line is
the recommended pull.

Model discovery is NATIVE (``/api/tags`` + ``/api/show``): with no configured
model the brain runs the smallest DOWNLOADED model whose declared capabilities
match the turn (``completion``, plus ``tools`` for tool turns, plus ``vision``
for a turn carrying images); ``:cloud`` references never count as local, and a
model-less server produces an honest "pull one first" error instead of a
hardcoded default that would 404.

**Vision is a MODEL property, never a server property.** A blanket
``supports_vision = True`` on the class made every Ollama install advertise
sight: ``resolve_vision_brain`` picked it for Screen Context and the CU planner
let it plan from screenshots, so a host whose only pull is a text-only model
answered *about* the picture it had never seen. The flag is therefore resolved
per SELECTED model from the cached catalog (the same route OpenRouter takes),
the image path negotiates a ``vision``-capable download, and a server without
one raises an honest error instead of describing a screenshot blind.
