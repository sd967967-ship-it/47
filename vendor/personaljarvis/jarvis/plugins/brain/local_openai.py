"""Generic local OpenAI-compatible brain (HuggingFace transformers serve & co).

One card for every self-hosted server that speaks the OpenAI Chat-Completions
format: HuggingFace ``transformers serve`` (port 8000), llama.cpp
``llama-server`` (port 8080), vLLM, LM Studio (port 1234) — and TGI installs
keep working, though TGI itself is in maintenance mode and never the
recommendation. Ollama has its own dedicated provider; this is the
bring-your-own-server slot.

Unlike the cloud brains there is NO vendor default endpoint — a base URL is
REQUIRED and its absence raises an honest, example-bearing error instead of
guessing a port. The credential is OPTIONAL (``local_openai_api_key`` /
``LOCAL_OPENAI_API_KEY``): most local servers ignore it, some (LM Studio
behind a reverse proxy, vLLM with ``--api-key``) check it. Keyless by design
(§3 / AP-22): ``local-openai`` stays ABSENT from
``PROVIDER_SECRET_CANDIDATES`` so the key-aware resolver treats it as always
reachable and a dead server just fast-fails across families.

Vision defaults to UNSUPPORTED and is only ever raised by evidence: whether a
given local server accepts image content is unknowable in general, so the
shared streamer DROPS images with a warning rather than letting a text-only
server reject the whole turn. When the server's own ``/v1/models`` DOES declare
image input for the selected model (some OpenAI-compatible servers publish the
modality fields), the cached catalog carries that declaration and this brain
believes it. Unknown stays blind — a confident description of a picture nobody
looked at is the failure mode worth being conservative about.
