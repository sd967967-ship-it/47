"""NVIDIA NIM — OpenAI-compatible gateway to NVIDIA-hosted LLMs.

One free NVIDIA API key (``nvapi-…`` from build.nvidia.com) reaches the models
NVIDIA hosts on its inference microservice (NIM): Nemotron, Llama, DeepSeek,
Qwen, Mistral, and more. The endpoint speaks the OpenAI Chat-Completions format,
so this brain is a thin binding of the shared ``_openai_base`` streamer to
NVIDIA's fixed base URL — the same shape as the OpenRouter/OpenAI brains.

Bring-your-own-key, capability-gated (never provider-name-gated, AP-21): a
missing key raises a clean error so the fallback chain crosses to whatever the
user actually has, and the model id comes from the user's pick (the live
``/v1/models`` catalog) — nothing here is load-bearing for a specific model.

# NVIDIA NIM's OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Only the ``nvapi-`` key from
# build.nvidia.com works here (NOT the legacy NGC key). Passed as the vendor
# default so an explicit ``[brain.providers.nvidia].base_url`` override or the
# team proxy can still redirect it (resolve_provider_endpoint).

# NIM-specific HTTP timeout. NVIDIA's hosted dev tier (build.nvidia.com) has a
# high, variable time-to-first-byte — measured 13-30s+ on a cold/queued model
# ("hi" @ max_tokens=8), well above the 2s TTFB of OpenAI/OpenRouter. The shared
# ``_openai_base.CLIENT_TIMEOUT`` (read=30s, tuned for the voice fast-fail path)
# therefore kills legitimate NIM calls with an APITimeoutError, which the
# provider test then mislabels as an integration error / "unreachable". A NIM
# call that connects but streams slowly is NOT a dead endpoint, so ``read`` is
# widened to tolerate the queue/cold-start latency while ``connect`` stays at 5s
# so a genuinely unreachable host still fast-fails and the fallback chain moves
# on. On the voice hot path the brain-tier stall guard still bounds the turn and
# crosses to a faster provider; this only lets the text/worker path finish.

# Last-resort default when the brain is built with NO model. A widely-hosted,
# tool-capable NIM model so a model-less construction still answers and can call
# tools; the manager passes the user's PICK in almost every path, so this only
# bites a genuinely model-less build. Kept off the reasoning flagships on
# purpose (latency) — the user selects Nemotron/DeepSeek from the live catalog.
