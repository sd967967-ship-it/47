"""Anthropic subscription brain — drives the ``claude`` CLI in print mode.

Jarvis already spends two subscriptions this way: ChatGPT through ``codex exec``
and Google through the Gemini CLI. Anthropic was the gap. The only Anthropic
brain was ``claude-api``, billed per token, so a user whose sole Anthropic
credential is a Claude plan could not spend it on brain work at all — and the
Agentic IDE's prompt composer, which needs a capable model or nothing, fell back
to its deterministic regex prompt on every single instruction for them.

This is deliberately NOT a voice-tier brain. Measured 2026-07-26 on a warm
machine: 10-12 s for a trivial prompt (essentially all process start-up) and
26.6 s for a real structured brief on the fastest model. Either number would
destroy a spoken turn. It exists for callers that are already waiting seconds
and whose OUTPUT is the product rather than a step towards it — and any caller
wiring this up needs a deadline well clear of 30 s, not the 45 s that sufficed
when only API providers wrote briefs.

Two shapes, one provider, chosen by the caller through ``structured_prompts``:

* **Conversational** (default) — a light "answer in a sentence or three" wrapper
  with the recent turns, mirroring the Codex sibling. The heavy router system
  prompt is dropped on purpose: it is large, tool-heavy, and misleading for a
  read-only CLI call.
* **Structured** — the caller's ``system`` IS the contract, so it rides in
  ``--system-prompt`` and the payload goes to stdin untouched. Claude Code takes
  a real system prompt, which makes this cleaner here than in the siblings that
  have to flatten everything into one blob.

Getting that choice wrong is the failure mode worth guarding: a structured
caller served conversationally gets three fluent sentences that read like a
valid result. Nobody inspects an answer that looks fine.

# assumes the empty value stays the documented "disable all" spelling. If a
