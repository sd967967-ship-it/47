"""Groq Whisper STT plugin.

Cloud STT via Groq's OpenAI-compatible audio API. Targets ``whisper-large-v3``
(Groq's hosted Whisper-v3 endpoint, ~200-400 ms warm latency).

Plugin contract: structurally compatible with ``jarvis.core.protocols.STTProvider``
without importing from ``jarvis.*``. The returned object is a locally defined
``Transcript`` dataclass with identical field shape; consumers duck-type on the
attributes (``text``, ``language``, ``confidence``, ``is_partial``, ``segments``).

Audio I/O contract (compatible with the Jarvis VAD output):
  * Input chunks expose ``.pcm`` (int16 little-endian bytes), ``.sample_rate``
    (Hz) and optionally ``.channels`` (default 1).
  * All chunks are concatenated and wrapped in an in-memory WAV container
    before multipart upload to Groq.

API key resolution order:
  1. constructor argument
  2. ``GROQ_API_KEY`` env var
  3. Windows Credential Manager via ``keyring`` (service ``personal-jarvis``,
     username ``groq_api_key``) — same convention as the rest of Jarvis,
     without importing ``jarvis.*`` (the third-party ``keyring`` package is
     a soft dependency; if it is missing the lookup is silently skipped).

Never accept a key from voice/chat input (AP-2).
