"""OpenAI Whisper STT plugin — cloud transcription via the OpenAI audio API.

One OpenAI API key — the SAME ``openai_api_key`` slot the OpenAI *brain* already
uses — unlocks cloud speech-to-text, so a downloader whose only credential is an
OpenAI key gets working voice input with no second key. This closes the single
biggest single-key STT gap: the cross-family table named ``openai-api`` but
shipped no plugin, so an OpenAI-only user dead-ended on the local
``faster-whisper`` engine the base install never bundles.

Endpoint (OpenAI-compatible audio API, identical wire shape to the Groq plugin):
  * ``POST {base_url}/audio/transcriptions`` (multipart upload),
  * Headers: ``Authorization: Bearer <key>``,
  * multipart fields: ``file`` (an in-memory WAV), ``model``, ``response_format``,
    optional ``language`` / ``prompt`` / ``temperature``.

The wire contract is NOT the same for every model, which is why the request is
built from a per-model capability shape (:mod:`jarvis.plugins.stt.capabilities`)
rather than from constants: ``whisper-1`` answers ``verbose_json`` with segment
timings and log probabilities, while ``gpt-4o-transcribe`` rejects that value
with HTTP 400 and transcribes nothing. A 400 that names an optional field
narrows the shape and retries; a 400 that names the MODEL falls back to the
default model once, loudly.

Model default: ``whisper-1`` — the universally-available transcription model
every OpenAI account can call. Gate on the capability, never a fancier model id
(AP-21); a user who wants a newer transcription model sets it in the STT model
field and the request adapts itself to that model's contract.

Plugin contract: structurally compatible with
``jarvis.core.protocols.STTProvider`` WITHOUT importing ``jarvis.*`` at import
time (entry-point plugins stay import-clean). The credential lookup imports
``jarvis.core.config`` lazily inside a method, mirroring the OpenRouter STT
plugin. The returned object is a locally defined ``Transcript`` dataclass with
the identical field shape; consumers duck-type on ``text`` / ``language`` /
``confidence`` / ``is_partial`` / ``segments``.

Audio I/O contract (compatible with the Jarvis VAD output):
  * ``transcribe`` consumes chunks exposing ``.pcm`` (int16 little-endian
    bytes), ``.sample_rate`` (Hz) and optionally ``.channels`` (default 1).
  * ``transcribe_pcm`` receives a full VAD-segmented utterance as raw int16 PCM
    at 16 kHz mono (the pipeline default) — the drop-in shim the speech
    pipeline actually calls.
  * All PCM is wrapped in an in-memory WAV container before multipart upload.

Credential resolution reuses ``jarvis.core.config.resolve_provider_endpoint``
(keyring -> ENV -> .env -> local-file fallback), exactly like the OpenAI brain.
A missing / dead (401) / out-of-credit (402) / rate-limited (429) / unreachable
key raises a clear English error so the STT factory degrades to the key-free
local ``faster-whisper`` floor instead of bricking voice input for a single-
provider user (AP-22). Never accept a key from voice/chat input (AP-2).
