    ``cuda -> cpu`` self-heal in :meth:`FasterWhisperProvider._ensure_model`
    remains the verdict, and a machine where this changes nothing lands there

    Why it is needed at all: on Windows ``cublas64_12.dll`` is resolved through

    Both halves are load-bearing and were separated by measurement:

# matches; on a mismatch or a prefetch failure it loads lazily as before —
