"""OpenRouter STT plugin — cloud transcription via the OpenRouter gateway.

One OpenRouter API key unlocks a whole family of hosted transcription models
(Whisper, GPT-4o-transcribe, Chirp, Voxtral, Parakeet, Qwen3-ASR, …). This
plugin reuses the SAME ``openrouter_api_key`` slot the OpenRouter *brain*
already uses, so a user who configured OpenRouter for chat gets cloud STT for
free — no second credential.

Endpoint (verified live 2026-07-02):
  * ``POST {base_url}/audio/transcriptions``
  * Headers: ``Authorization: Bearer <key>``, ``Content-Type: application/json``
    (plus the courtesy ``HTTP-Referer`` / ``X-Title`` OpenRouter attribution
    headers the brain adapter also sends).
  * JSON body: ``{"model": "<id>", "input_audio": {"data": "<base64 RAW audio
    bytes, NOT a data-URI>", "format": "wav"}, "language": "<ISO-639-1>"?,
    "temperature": <0-1>?}``. Which of the optional fields a given model
    accepts is a per-MODEL question the gateway answers with 400, so the body
    is shaped by :mod:`jarvis.plugins.stt.capabilities` and narrowed on a
    refusal rather than pinned to a lowest common denominator.
  * JSON response: ``{"text": "...", "usage": {"seconds": ..., "cost": ...,
    "total_tokens": ...?}}`` with an ``X-Generation-Id`` response header. No
    streaming — a single final ``Transcript`` is returned.

Plugin contract: structurally compatible with
``jarvis.core.protocols.STTProvider`` WITHOUT importing ``jarvis.*`` from the
plugin module (entry-point plugins must stay import-clean). The returned object
is a locally defined ``Transcript`` dataclass with the identical field shape;
consumers duck-type on ``text`` / ``language`` / ``confidence`` / ``is_partial``
/ ``segments``.

Audio I/O contract (compatible with the Jarvis VAD output):
  * ``transcribe`` consumes chunks exposing ``.pcm`` (int16 little-endian
    bytes), ``.sample_rate`` (Hz) and optionally ``.channels`` (default 1).
  * ``transcribe_pcm`` receives a full VAD-segmented utterance as raw int16 PCM
    at 16 kHz mono (the pipeline default) — the drop-in shim the speech
    pipeline actually calls.
  * All PCM is wrapped in an in-memory WAV container before base64 upload.

Credential resolution reuses ``jarvis.core.config.resolve_provider_endpoint``
(keyring → ENV → .env → local-file fallback), exactly like the OpenRouter
brain. A missing / dead (401) / out-of-credit (402) / rate-limited (429) /
unreachable key raises a clear English error so the STT factory can degrade to
the key-free local ``faster-whisper`` floor instead of bricking voice input
for a single-provider user (AP-22). Never accept a key from voice/chat (AP-2).

    the pipeline's transient-error retry ladder was dead code for this plugin

    same convention the Groq plugin uses when segments are absent.

    a decoder repetition loop, a hesitation sound, a stutter, an outer quote
    pair, NFD umlauts — can be removed before every consumer downstream starts
    reading the string. The untouched payload text stays on ``raw_text``.

    Confidence is computed from the RAW text, not the cleaned one. The two only
    diverge when cleanup emptied the string, and that is a cleanup defect, not
    a silent utterance — reporting 0.0 there would hand the pipeline a "nothing
