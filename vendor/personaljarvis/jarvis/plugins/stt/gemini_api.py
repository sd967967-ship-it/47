"""Gemini STT plugin — cloud transcription via google-genai inline audio.

The Gemini-only downloader is the recommended-default persona, yet the STT
cross-family table named ``gemini-api`` with no plugin behind it — so a user
whose ONLY key is a Google AI-Studio (Gemini) key got NO cloud speech-to-text
and dead-ended on the local ``faster-whisper`` engine the base install never
bundles. This plugin closes that gap by transcribing through the SAME Gemini
credential the brain and TTS already use — no second key.

How it works (and its honest limits): Gemini has no dedicated transcription
endpoint. Instead this uses the model's multimodal audio understanding —
``generate_content`` with the utterance as an inline ``audio/wav`` part and a
tight instruction to emit the verbatim transcript only. That is GENERATIVE
transcription, so it is best-effort: it is fed a full VAD-segmented utterance
(real speech that already passed voice-activity detection), returns free-form
text with no per-segment timings or confidence, and can add stray preamble that
the light output cleanup below trims. It is a working cloud STT for a Gemini-only
user, not a drop-in equal of a dedicated ASR model.

Model default: the same widely-served Gemini flash model the brain defaults to.
Gate on the capability, never a fancier model id (AP-21) — any audio-capable
Gemini model works; a user can set another in the STT model field.

Plugin contract: structurally compatible with
``jarvis.core.protocols.STTProvider`` WITHOUT importing ``jarvis.*`` at import
time (entry-point plugins stay import-clean). The credential lookup imports
``jarvis.core.config`` lazily inside a method, mirroring the Gemini brain. The
returned object is a locally defined ``Transcript`` dataclass with the identical
field shape; consumers duck-type on ``text`` / ``language`` / ``confidence`` /
``is_partial`` / ``segments``.

Audio I/O contract (compatible with the Jarvis VAD output):
  * ``transcribe`` consumes chunks exposing ``.pcm`` (int16 little-endian
    bytes), ``.sample_rate`` (Hz) and optionally ``.channels`` (default 1).
  * ``transcribe_pcm`` receives a full VAD-segmented utterance as raw int16 PCM
    at 16 kHz mono (the pipeline default) — the drop-in shim the speech
    pipeline actually calls.
  * All PCM is wrapped in an in-memory WAV container before the inline upload.

Credential resolution reuses ``jarvis.core.config.resolve_provider_endpoint``
(keyring -> ENV -> .env -> local-file fallback), exactly like the Gemini brain.
A missing key, an unavailable ``google-genai`` package, or an API error raises a
clear English error so the STT factory degrades to the key-free local
``faster-whisper`` floor instead of bricking voice input for a single-provider
user (AP-22). Never accept a key from voice/chat input (AP-2).

    """The same Gemini audio understanding on Google Cloud Vertex AI.

    Audio transcription on Vertex is a plain ``generateContent`` call with an
    inline audio part — byte-for-byte the request its AI Studio sibling builds —
    so this class changes only the account it bills and the endpoint it opens.
    Everything above it (the WAV framing, the language handling, the transcript
    cleanup, the error mapper) is shared.

    Why it is a separate card rather than a routing detail: a Cloud project has
    its own quota and its own bill, and an install may hold both credentials.
    The user picks which one transcribes their voice.
