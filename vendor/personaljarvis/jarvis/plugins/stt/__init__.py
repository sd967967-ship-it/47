    Distinct from :func:`build_stt_from_config` (the post-wake *utterance* STT,
    often a cloud provider). This instance only powers wake-phrase transcript
    matching + the listening-bubble probe — both latency-tolerant — so it loads
    a small model on CPU by default (``stt_cfg.wake_model`` / ``wake_device`` /
    ``wake_compute_type``), NOT the heavy utterance model on the GPU.

    Why this matters for boot: on a Blackwell GPU (RTX 50xx) CTranslate2 JIT-
    compiles kernels at model load, costing ~71 s on CUDA vs ~0.45 s for ``base``
    on CPU (measured) — the dominant Phase-A warm-up cost. CPU is also the
    cloud-first floor. ``getattr`` fallbacks keep a pre-wake_*-field config (or a
    bare stub) building a safe small/cpu instance.

    ``wake_phrase`` (forensic 2026-06-22): when a user sets a CUSTOM wake word
    with no pretrained openWakeWord model ("Hey Ruben"), the wake routes to this
    small CPU model. ``base`` transcribed the proper noun as a common word
    ("Ruben" -> "job") so the wake never fired. Passing the spoken trigger here
    seeds Whisper's ``initial_prompt`` so it biases toward the actual name. This
    is deliberately scoped to the custom stt_match wake (the pipeline only
    forwards a phrase on that path) — the default "Hey Jarvis"/OWW paths pass
    nothing, so the hot-path prompt-hallucination caveat in
    ``FasterWhisperProvider.__init__`` does not apply to them.

    Bias is ON (forensic 2026-06-23). It was once disabled out of a hallucination
    concern, but that disabled the custom wake word entirely: empirically, on the
    user's real wake WAVs the unbiased base/cpu model heard "Hey Ruben" as
    "Space"/"Ego"/"Herum" -> 2-13% recall; seeding ``wake_phrase`` as the
    ``initial_prompt`` lifts that to 83%. The earlier false-wake risk is held off
    by the strict ["hey","ruben"] matcher (a stray "Ruben" in ordinary speech is
    not an adjacent "hey ruben") plus the ``no_speech_prob``/RMS gates, which kept
    the false-wake rate ~0% on 50 real talking-about-Ruben clips. The bias is
    scoped to this path: only the stt_match custom-phrase route forwards a
    ``wake_phrase``; the default "Hey Jarvis"/OWW paths pass nothing and stay
    unbiased, so the hot-path prompt-hallucination caveat in
    ``FasterWhisperProvider.__init__`` does not apply to them. A blank phrase is
    treated as no bias.
