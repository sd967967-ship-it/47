"""Deepgram STT plugin (batch REST, Nova-3).

Cloud speech-to-text through Deepgram's ``/v1/listen`` endpoint. Deepgram is a
useful third cloud lane because its free tier is generous and its Nova-3 model
has a dedicated German recognizer plus a multilingual variant that handles
German/English code-switching in one stream — the two languages this app is
used in most.

Plugin contract: structurally compatible with ``jarvis.core.protocols.STTProvider``
without importing from ``jarvis.*`` at module level. The returned object is a
locally defined ``Transcript`` dataclass with the same field shape; consumers
duck-type on the attributes (``text``, ``language``, ``confidence``,
``is_partial``, ``segments``).

## How this differs from the OpenAI-shaped plugins

Deepgram is NOT OpenAI-compatible, and the three differences all matter:

* **Auth header is ``Token``, not ``Bearer``.** A ``Bearer`` prefix is rejected
  with 401, which reads exactly like a wrong key and sends people to rotate a
  credential that was fine.
* **The audio is the raw request body**, not a multipart field. The container
  format is declared in ``Content-Type``.
* **Options are query parameters**, not form fields, and language detection is
  its own flag (``detect_language=true``) rather than "omit the language".

## Batch, not streaming — on purpose

Deepgram's real advantage is interim results over a WebSocket, and this plugin
does not use them. Nothing in the speech pipeline consumes interim transcripts
today: ``_handle_utterance`` hands over one complete VAD-segmented utterance
and expects one final transcript. Shipping a streaming plugin into a batch-only
pipeline would add a socket and deliver no lower latency. ``stream_transcribe``
therefore yields a single final transcript, exactly like the other cloud
plugins, and the streaming path stays a separate piece of work that has to
change the pipeline to be worth anything.

API key resolution order (same convention as every other plugin here):
  1. constructor argument
  2. ``DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`` env var
  3. OS credential manager via ``keyring`` (service ``personal-jarvis``,
     username ``deepgram_api_key``) — the name the setup wizard already writes.

Never accept a key from voice/chat input (AP-2).
