"""openWakeWord plugin — runs a user-trained wake model on the audio stream.

openWakeWord is a free, open-source wake-word runtime (MIT) on top of the
ONNX runtime — zero API key needed. The product ships NO named wake model
(design 2026-07-07): this provider only ever loads an explicit ``model_path``
(the user's own trained custom .onnx); without one it is a logged no-op.

Input format: 16 kHz mono int16 PCM, frame size must be 1280 samples (80 ms).
We buffer mic chunks and split on the frame boundary.

Output: continuous score [0, 1] per keyword — we filter on
`activation_threshold` and debounce (no re-trigger within the cooldown).

# false-fires land in the 0.05-0.11 score band, while genuine "Hey Jarvis"
# utterances peak at 0.15-0.23. 0.15 sits clearly above the ambient ceiling so

# RollingWhisperWake pattern ("hey/hi/hallo"+"jarv") still catches quieter
# genuine wakes and can never match bare "Hallo".
#
# Threshold-pendulum history (each entry over- or under-corrected the previous):
#   0.40 -> 0.15 -> 0.10 -> 0.06 (over-correction: orb popped on every word)

#     into this band so a normal-volume utterance crosses it without shouting.
#   * DEBOUNCE — after a real trigger the detector stays quiet for ``cooldown_s``
#     so ONE spoken wake word yields exactly once (no machine-gun re-fire).
#   * REJECT REFRACTORY — when the pipeline's STT prefix-verify rejects a
#     candidate (``note_rejected_candidate``), the long debounce is cut to a
#     short ``_REJECT_REFRACTORY_S`` so a genuine wake spoken right after a false
#     positive still gets through, while continuous jarvis-like background audio
#     cannot spin a reject->retrigger busy-loop.
# There is no separate "release" threshold: the cooldown IS the hysteresis that
# keeps a sustained near-threshold score from chattering, and the BUG-009 floor
# (>= 0.10, pinned by tests/unit/speech/test_wake_threshold.py) keeps the FIRE
# bar above the ambient false-fire band.

    Root cause of "the wake word only triggers when I shout" (2026-06-28): the
    fast openWakeWord detector fed RAW int16 frames into the neural model, whose
    activation score scales with input level, so on a quiet mic a genuine
    "Hey Jarvis" under-scored the pinned 0.15 threshold and only a shout crossed
    it. The 2026-06-28 fix added peak normalization but gated it on a FIXED
    ``noise_floor_peak=0.02`` — a genuinely quiet wake between that floor and true
    silence still got zero gain. This now uses an ADAPTIVE floor (mission
    2026-06-30): on a quiet mic the floor settles to the real ambient level, so a
    quiet wake rises above it and is amplified, while flat silence / steady
    sub-floor hiss is still left unchanged. The 0.15 threshold and the
    amplify-only + sub-floor guards are unchanged, so quiet wakes are lifted
    without widening the ambient false-fire band.
