"""Universal any-word wake detector via Vosk grammar keyword spotting.

The one-identical-system-everywhere wake engine
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-universal-wake-kws-design.md): a small
per-language Vosk model (Apache-2.0, official CPU wheels for
Windows/macOS/Linux x86+ARM, torch-free) streams microphone audio through a
GRAMMAR-constrained recognizer that only knows the configured wake phrase(s)
plus ``[unk]``. Any freely chosen word is pure configuration — no per-user
training, no cloud, no GPU.

Spike-measured on 5250 real captured windows (2026-07-05): grammar mode hears
the hard German-spoken name at 96 % where pretrained en/zh KWS models sit at
0-4 %; the two-stage arrangement below lands at 79-100 % recall with
1/0/0 % false accepts (ambient/quiet/silence) at ~0.05x realtime CPU.

Two-stage detection, AP-27-safe:

1. **Streaming grammar detector** — partial results fire DURING the phrase
   (measured t=1.3 s into a 1.8 s utterance), finals carry per-word
   confidence. The grammar forces every utterance onto the nearest phrase, so
   stage 1 alone false-accepts on ambient speech (34 % measured) and must
   never fire unconfirmed.
2. **Structured free-decode sound confirm** — ONE unconstrained pass over the
   ring-buffered candidate audio. For a prefixed phrase, the free transcript
   must contain a real wake prefix immediately followed by a sound-close core.
   This keeps ASR spelling/splitting tolerance (for example, "joe avis" for
   "Jarvis") without letting a high-confidence grammar hallucination turn
   unrelated room speech into a wake. When the free ear could not spell the
   word, the word-agnostic SHAPE of what it heard decides instead — and any
   shape that is either a clean wake shape or merely contested (a re-tokenised
   prefix, a name the decoder knows as an ordinary word) must win the acoustic
   competition against an explicit "<prefix> [unk]" grammar alternative, or a
   call of a DIFFERENT name fires too (live 2026-07-17). Infrastructure errors
   fail OPEN so a broken confirm cannot eat a real wake.

A raw-energy gate (word-agnostic RMS at the match site, AP-27) rejects
near-silent candidates before the confirm. The detector never emits
transcript text — its only output is the fired keyword (design criterion:
user speech must never double-enter the pipeline through the wake path).

**Candidate-prefix verify + early visual.** A PARTIAL hit waits
``confirm_tail_s`` before the fallback verify, so the bar used to react
~0.85-1.0 s after the phrase. The early check runs the SAME three verify
checks immediately over the audio heard so far (truncated ring) in a worker
thread. A positive result is authoritative for that candidate and also tells
``early_candidate_listener`` to show the bar — typically ~0.1-0.25 s after
the partial, i.e. around phrase end. Later audio is session speech and cannot
revoke that already-verified prefix. If the truncated check rejects, the
normal full-window verify still runs after the tail, so early truncation never
eats a wake.
Calibrated 2026-07-11 on real captured windows (400 pos / 2500 neg per
phrase): a conf gate alone leaks 0.84-12 % of room-speech windows (the
flicker that got the plain candidate reveal reverted, 5fe5c4d2); the full
mini-verify leaks 0/2500 ("hey jarvis") and 1-2/2500 (worst-case single
word) while early-confirming ~a third of eventual fires. Infrastructure errors
fail CLOSED in the prefix check — the opposite polarity of the fallback
full-window confirm, which fails open so it can never eat a real wake.

**Weak-CPU spawn latency (measured 2026-08-19 on a 4-core 15 W laptop).**
Three costs made the bar arrive 1-3 s after the phrase there where a desktop
CPU shows it ~0.5 s after:

* The authoritative confirm re-decoded the whole 3 s ring from scratch AFTER
  the confirm tail (0.4-0.9 s on that CPU vs ~0.1-0.2 s on a fast one). The
  confirm is now STREAMED: its grammar + free recognizers are taken at
  PARTIAL time, fed the ring immediately and then every tail chunk as it
  lands, so at tail end only ``FinalResult`` remains (~0.1 s). Same audio,
  same recognizers, same judgement — only *when* the decode runs moved
  (``_StreamingVerify``). The from-scratch path stays for finals, latched
  retries and the sibling rescue, and is the fallback when streaming errors.
* While the loop awaited that confirm it consumed no audio; the fanout
  queue (0.6 s) overflowed and DROPPED the oldest frames (live: ``oww_q=19``
  at every candidate) — the ring then had holes and the re-score heard ''
  ("say it twice"). The detector now declares a deeper intake budget
  (``intake_backlog_s``) and a 1 s catch-up batch (``coalesce_catchup_s``);
  the pipeline honours both only for detectors that can catch up in batches.
* Every installed language model streamed stage 1 on every chunk (three
  models ~0.8x realtime of one core during speech on that CPU; >2x under
  desktop load — the detector fell seconds behind). Stage 1 now DEMOTES the
  last secondary model when its own decode cost proves it cannot keep up
  (``_STAGE1_SLOW_RT`` on several recent calls); demoted models stay
  loaded for verify/rescue and return on the next ``detect()`` session. The
  primary model is never demoted.

**Native concurrency (BUG-151, fixed 2026-08-20).** libvosk 0.3.44 is safe
for many recognizers DECODING concurrently on one Model, but concurrent
construction + short decode + ``FinalResult`` access-violates the process.
Every native constructor and method now goes through
``jarvis.plugins.wake.vosk_native`` (one process-wide lock). Python-level
grammar/free submit still runs on two threads so the 2026-07-10 spawn-latency
structure stays; the lock serialises the native calls themselves. Test
doubles are not wrapped, so the concurrent-barrier unit test still proves
the submit shape.

# Everything above asks the free decoder to SPELL the wake word. An offline
# small model has no arbitrary proper noun in its lexicon, so it CANNOT.
# Replaying 159 real captured "Hey Ruben" calls (data/wake_debug) through this
# detector: the free decoder spelled the phrase in only 28 % of genuine calls
# and otherwise produced sound-alike garbage — "herum", "erhoben", "hey room",
# "hey oben", "heroes". Rejecting on that garbage ate 38 % of all real wakes
# (end-to-end recall 32 %; the user had to repeat the phrase four or five
# times) while false accepts sat at 0/400. And no spelling threshold can close
# it: the free transcript "herr oben" was produced BOTH by a genuine call and
# by room chatter. Spelling cannot discriminate an out-of-vocabulary word — and
# EVERY wake word is out-of-vocabulary for some installed language model. That
# is precisely AP-27, reappearing in the Vosk path.
#
# What DOES discriminate, without ever asking how the wake word is written, is
# the SHAPE of what the free ear heard AT the candidate span:
#   * a wake call is short and stands alone    (measured: 0.72 s, 2 words)
#   * room speech is a longer word stream the  (measured: 1.29 s, 5 words,
#     decoder confidently recognises            top word confidence ~1.0)
# Both bounds are derived from the CONFIGURED phrase, never from its spelling,
# so they hold for any phrase in any supported language. ``sound_confirm``
# remains a BONUS path that may only ACCEPT (a free ear that did spell the
# phrase still fires instantly), so this can never make the detector deaf.
#
# Calibrated on 250 positive / 1650 negative real captured windows: verify
# pass-rate on genuine calls 55 % -> 74 %, at 3 false accepts (two of which are
# genuine calls the corpus labels negative: "ey ruben", "hei ruben").

# heard the prefix plus a 0.12 s grunt: the NAME was never spoken and the
# grammar had stretched a bare "hey" onto the phrase.
#
# Neither spelling nor sound-similarity can catch that — measured on the real
# captures, room speech scores HIGHER against "ruben" (`den genie ring` 0.50,
# `simple frage brauchen` 0.62) than genuine calls do (`hey room` 0.25,
# `hey ho` 0.25). Any similarity floor that rejects the false wake also rejects

# uttered where the name belongs? Strip the known wake prefixes from what the

# Real captures: genuine calls carry a 0.48 s median core body (p10 0.30 s);

# --- three-way shape verdict (AP-27, forensic 2026-08-04) -------------------
# Two of the four shape questions turned out to rest on a SPELLING assumption
# after all, which is the AP-27 trap one more level down. Measured on this box
# against the real en model, one German and one US voice per phrase:
#
#   "Hey Ben"   spoken de -> free ear "have you been"   (3 tokens, all conf 1.00)
#   "Hey Atlas" spoken de -> free ear "have you at last"(4 tokens, all conf 1.00)
#   "Hey Ruben" spoken de -> free ear "have you been"   (3 tokens, all conf 1.00)
#
# Both broken premises are visible in that one line:
#   * the TOKEN COUNT assumes the free ear spends one token on the wake prefix.
#     A short function word in a foreign accent is re-tokenised ("hey" ->
#     "have you"), so a genuine two-token call arrives as three or four and is
#     charged against the phrase's own budget.
#   * the CONFIDENCE veto assumes the wake word is out-of-vocabulary. Every
#     name that IS an ordinary word ("Ben" -> "been", "Claude" -> "cloud")
#     makes the free ear certain, and the rule reads that certainty as proof
#     that some OTHER word was said.
# Live consequence on this install (2026-08-04 17:01-17:02): 3 candidates,
# 2 suppressed, 1 fired — the user says the wake word three times.
#
# Neither premise can be repaired by moving a threshold, so the two questions
# stop being VETOES and become a reason to ask the acoustic competition —
# the purely acoustic judgement that already gates every shape acceptance.
# Measured on the same synthesised corpus (8 genuine calls, 20 unrelated
# utterances incl. the recorded live false-wake transcripts): the competitor
# grammar keeps the phrase for 8/8 genuine calls and 0/20 unrelated ones.
#
# The other two questions stay HARD rejections: they measure how much sound was
# made, never what it was, so no accent or vocabulary can invert them.
SHAPE_WAKE = "wake"            # looks like a call — competition confirms as before
SHAPE_UNDECIDED = "undecided"  # tokenisation/confidence contradicts — competition decides
SHAPE_SPEECH = "speech"        # too much sound, or no name-sized body: never a wake

# (The former "leading isolation" gate — a hard rejection of any candidate
# with voiced speech in the 0.6 s before the span, added 2026-08-10 — was
# REMOVED 2026-08-12 by explicit maintainer mandate: the wake word must fire
# when spoken in the middle or at the end of a longer sentence, with no dead
# time after prior speech. The mid-stream precision it bought is now owed by
# the SPAN-TRIMMED, hypothesis-aware acoustic competition below, which was
# bench-measured to kill the same mid-dictation false-fire classes WITHOUT
# demanding silence before the phrase — see scripts/vosk_wake_bench.py.)

# --- acoustic competition for the SHAPE path (live forensic 2026-07-17) -----
# The shape gate accepts anything that LOOKS like a wake call — which a call of
# a DIFFERENT name also does. Live: "hey nova" confirmed (shape) for the phrase
# "Hey Jarvis", "hey ruben" for "Hey Nova": every "<prefix> <other name>" call
# has exactly the shape of a genuine wake, so shape alone cannot separate them
# — and per AP-27 no spelling rule may reject either (measured again on this
# corpus: the free-decode confidences of adversarial calls are indistinguishable
# from genuine garbles, 0.45–0.88 both).
#
# What DOES separate them, without ever reading a spelling, is an ACOUSTIC
# competition: re-score the window with a grammar that offers, next to the
# configured phrase, an explicit "<prefix> [unk]" alternative. The decoder then
# chooses whether the name slot is better explained by the configured wake word
# or by ANY other word. A shape-only acceptance must win that competition; the
# spelling path stays accept-only and never consults it (a free ear that wrote
# the phrase down is stronger evidence than the competition is).
#
# Replay-calibrated on 918 real captured windows embedded in live-like ring
# context (2026-07-17, three phrases x foreign-name calls + ambient): kills
# every shape-path foreign-name fire (2 -> 0) at a 1-2 % genuine-recall cost,
# where gating the WHOLE verify on the competition (not just the shape path)
# cost 13 % of genuine "Hey Ruben" calls — that variant was rejected.

# already competes against the bare "[unk]" in the normal re-score grammar and

    """Does the free ear's output AT the candidate span look like a wake call?

    Word-agnostic by construction (AP-27): it reads only how much was said at
    the span and how sure the free decoder was — never how the wake word is
    spelled. ``local_words`` are the free decode's word dicts (``word``,
    ``start``, ``end``, ``conf``) already localised to the phrase span.

    Four word-agnostic questions, all scaled by the configured phrase. Two of
    them are HARD (``SHAPE_SPEECH`` — nothing may overrule them), two only make
    the candidate ``SHAPE_UNDECIDED`` and hand it to the acoustic competition:

    1. **Not spoken for longer than the phrase could be.** HARD. The grammar
       happily stretches the phrase across flowing speech; a real call cannot
       last longer than its own tokens do. Pure duration — no accent, no
       vocabulary and no tokenisation can invert it.
    2. **A name was actually spoken.** HARD. Strip the known wake prefixes and
       the REMAINING voiced duration — the core body — must be at least a
       syllable. Without this the other bounds describe a bare interjection
       just as well as a wake call, and "hey ho" fires (live 2026-07-13). It
       never reads the name's SPELLING: it only asks whether a name-sized
       sound exists where the name belongs.
    3. **Not more words than the phrase has.** UNDECIDED. A wake call is the
       phrase; a forced grammar hit on conversation carries the surrounding
       words too. But the count assumes the free ear tokenises the phrase the
       way the phrase is written, and a wake PREFIX in a foreign accent is
       routinely re-tokenised ("hey" -> "have you", measured 2026-08-04), so a
       genuine call arrives over budget. (A SPLIT name — "Jarvis" -> "joe
       avis" — is already accepted by ``sound_confirm``'s core_sizes
       tolerance.)
    4. **The free ear is not SURE it heard another core word.** UNDECIDED.
       This is the signal an out-of-vocabulary wake word leaves behind: the
       free decoder does not know the core, so it guesses and its confidence
       drops. But a name that IS an ordinary word ("Ben" -> "been") is
       recognised outright, and then certainty means the opposite of what this
       rule reads into it. A known wake prefix is excluded from the check.

    Empty input is ``SHAPE_SPEECH``: the grammar claimed the phrase where the
    free ear heard no speech at all.

    ``span`` (start_s, end_s — the UNPADDED phrase span from the grammar
    re-score) clips each word's duration contribution to the audio the phrase
    actually claims. Without it, a wake embedded in a sentence always fails
    the duration bounds: the ±0.3 s slack that selects ``local_words`` pulls
    the neighbouring sentence words in, and their full durations overflow a
    budget meant to measure the CALL (bench 2026-08-12: a genuine embedded
    'Hey George' arrived as 'fetish hate you watch much' — 1.62 s voiced —
    and was hard-rejected). Clipping is pure timing arithmetic (AP-27-safe)
    and keeps the original rejection intact: a grammar hit STRETCHED across
    flowing speech has its span full of speech, clipped or not.

    Why: the confirm used to run only after the tail had landed, re-decoding
    the whole 3 s ring from scratch — 0.4-0.9 s on a 15 W laptop core, i.e.
    most of the spawn latency there. Kaldi recognizers are streaming decoders,
    so the SAME two one-shot recognizers (grammar re-score + free ear) can
    start on the ring the moment the partial fires and then eat each tail
    chunk as it arrives; at tail end only ``FinalResult`` is left. Audio,
    recognizers and every downstream threshold are unchanged — only the moment
    the decode runs moved, which is why this is a latency change and not a
    decision change. (``AcceptWaveform`` slices any buffer into 0.2 s steps
    internally, so feeding the ring and then 32 ms chunks decodes exactly what
    one 3.6 s buffer would.)

    Threading (BUG-151): FEEDS run on one single-worker executor per
    recognizer — ordered, never overlapping on one native recognizer (AP-24).
    The two executors still submit in parallel (the 2026-07-10 spawn-latency
    shape); ``vosk_native.LockedRecognizer`` serialises the native calls so
    this is not the crashy concurrent short-decode-and-finalise cycle. The two
    FINALS still run sequentially on the finishing thread after every feed has
    landed. The window and the normalised pcm are accumulated here so the
    judgement sees exactly what the recognizers decoded. Peak normalisation
    uses the gain measured over the ring at partial time; the tail keeps that
    gain (clipped), which is the one place this differs from the from-scratch
    path — the phrase itself, the part the re-score and the span RMS judge, is

        Why this shape (live forensic 2026-07-06, "Hey Ruben" fired on plain
        room speech every few minutes): the streaming PARTIAL that makes the
        detector fast carries no confidence — its 1.00 placeholder sailed
        through the conf gate — and the old confirm compared the phrase
        against the BEST two-word window anywhere in ~3 s of speech, so for a
        phrase built from common German sounds SOME pair ("herr oben",
        "bei ihm") always eventually cleared 0.55. Both holes were
        word-dependent — exactly the class this engine exists to kill.

        1. **Grammar re-score**: a fresh grammar pass over the window must
           re-hear the phrase as a FINAL — yielding a real per-word confidence
           (gate: ``min_final_conf``) and the phrase's TIME SPAN.
        2. **Energy**: the word-agnostic RMS floor is measured over that span
           (not the whole ring, where surrounding silence dilutes it — AP-27:
           silence gates on energy, never transcript).
        3. **Localised sound confirm**: the free decode keeps only words
           OVERLAPPING the span (±0.3 s) — the permissive sound match then
           judges what was said AT the candidate's position instead of
           fishing the best pair out of three seconds of conversation.
        4. **Span-trimmed acoustic competition** (shape/undecided acceptances
           only): the candidate's OWN audio, cut to the phrase span, must be
           better explained by the configured phrase than by "<prefix> [unk]",
           plain "[unk]", or the free ear's own hypothesis — see
           ``_shape_competition_ok``. (This replaced the 2026-08-10 "leading
           isolation" silence-before-the-phrase gate on 2026-08-12: the
           maintainer mandated mid-sentence wakes, so precision now comes
           from judging the span's content, not its position.)

        On infrastructure errors the ``fail_open`` polarity decides: the
        authoritative confirm accepts (a broken confirm must never eat a real
        wake), the visual-only early check rejects. A clean "the phrase is
        not there" is always a rejection.

        Latency (spawn-latency mission, 2026-07-10): the grammar re-score and
        the free decode are independent Kaldi passes over the SAME audio —
        the free decode does not consume the re-score's output, only the
        LATER span-filtering step does. Measured on the real German small
        model (data/wake_models/vosk/de/vosk-model-small-de-0.15): the free
        pass costs 3-5x the grammar pass (e.g. 235ms vs 70ms over a 3 s
        window), so running them sequentially pays their SUM even though the
        wall-clock floor is only their MAX. They submit concurrently in two
        worker threads against ONE shared, read-only ``Model``. Each thread
        owns its own fresh recognizer (AP-24). Native calls serialise on the
        BUG-151 lock so this is not the crashy concurrent
        short-decode-and-finalise cycle. Decision is unchanged: both passes
        decode the identical ``pcm`` and every downstream
        threshold/comparison is untouched.

        Two entry shapes share the judgement below (``_judge_decoded``): this
        from-scratch decode (finals, latched retries, sibling rescue, early
        check) and the STREAMED decode a partial candidate pays during its
        confirm tail (``_StreamingVerify`` → ``_finish_streaming_verify``).

        Re-scores the candidate with a grammar that offers, next to the
        configured phrase, an explicit "<prefix> [unk]" competitor, a plain
        "[unk]", and — decisively — the free ear's OWN hypothesis for the
        span: the decoder itself chooses whether the audio is better explained
        by the configured wake word or by what the unconstrained pass actually
        heard there. The candidate already passed the normal re-score, the
        energy gate, and the shape gate — this breaks the tie the forced
        no-alternative grammar could not express.

        Two changes bench-measured on 2026-08-12 (scripts/vosk_wake_bench.py;
        live false fires 'pedro' / 'age watch' / 'hey nova' for "Hey George"):

        * ``pcm`` is the SPAN-TRIMMED audio, not the whole 3 s ring. Over the
          full ring the forced alignment could place the phrase anywhere and
          absorb the rest into [unk]s — it kept the phrase at conf 1.0 for
          nearly every short speech burst, so the competition confirmed
          random words. On the span alone the phrase must explain exactly the
          audio it claims.
        * ``free_hypothesis`` (the free decode's words at the span, in-vocab
          for the SAME model by construction) joins the alternatives. A
          decoder offered its own best guess next to the phrase only keeps
          the phrase when the audio genuinely supports it — 'peter' audio
          picks 'peter', a garbled genuine call still picks the phrase.

        Infrastructure errors accept (a broken extra check must never make the
        detector deaf; the spelling path never consults this at all).

        Since 2026-08-04 this also DECIDES a contested shape (``SHAPE_UNDECIDED``)
        rather than only confirming a clean one. The fail-open polarity is kept
        deliberately: it matches the authoritative confirm this runs inside, and
        a candidate only gets here after the grammar re-score (conf >= 0.9), the
        energy gate and the hard shape bounds — so a broken competitor
        recognizer degrades to those gates, not to no gate at all.
