    Same wire protocol, same session machinery, same event translation — the

    ``credential_family`` on purpose: that value is what stops the shared
    session fallback from retrying a terminal billing or auth failure through an
    alias backed by the very same credential (AP-22). A Cloud project and an AI
    Studio account fail independently, so crossing between them is a real
    fallback rather than a doomed retry.

    Authentication, measured 2026-08-17 against a live Cloud project: Vertex
    accepts an API key ONLY in express mode. A standard Google Cloud API key —
    even one restricted to ``aiplatform.googleapis.com`` — is refused on every
    Vertex surface with "API keys are not supported by this API. Expected OAuth2
    access token or other authentication credentials that assert a principal",
    and the Live socket closes with 1008 carrying that same text. So the Cloud
    project path (``[google].vertex_project`` + Application Default
    Credentials) is not a nicety here; for a normal project it is the only way
    in. The card says so.

    If a given key or project cannot open the duplex socket, the handshake fails
    and the realtime factory crosses to the next credential-ready provider — and
    finally to the classic pipeline. Nothing here claims a capability it has not
    proven.
