"""Gemini 3.1 Flash TTS Plugin (Public Preview, since 2026-04-16).

Uses AI-Studio / `google-genai` with simple API-key auth. Gemini returns
`audio/l16; rate=24000; channels=1` — raw linear PCM, no header, no
ffmpeg decoding needed.

Streaming (since 2026-06-10): with ``streaming=True`` the first sentence is
synthesized via ``client.aio.models.generate_content_stream`` and its PCM
pieces are yielded AS THEY ARRIVE — measured time-to-first-audio drops from
2.4–8.1 s (blocking full generation) to 0.6–1.3 s on the same model/voice.
It is still ONE generation per sentence (seed/temperature apply unchanged),
so voice consistency is identical to the blocking path. The historical note
"AI Studio only returns complete responses" was disproven empirically
(114 incremental chunks over Vertex, scripts/probe_tts_streaming.py).

Pseudo-streaming via sentence-by-sentence synthesis also remains: with
``chunk_by_sentence=True`` the text splits at ``.!?`` boundaries; sentence 1
streams live, sentences 2..N prefetch in parallel and yield in order.

    AI Studio preview TTS model is hard-capped at 100 requests/day, and a
    production voice cannot live inside that (2026-05-26). What it did NOT have
    was a way for the user to CHOOSE it: the route hung off ``[tts].use_vertex``
    plus a hand-set env var, invisible in the app, with a project id derived
    from a service-account file.

    This class is that choice made visible. It resolves the shared Vertex
    credential — the same key slot and the same ``[google].vertex_project`` the
    brain, STT and realtime tiers use — so setting Vertex up once serves the
    whole stack instead of one tier at a time. The voice catalogue, the
    sentence chunking, the streaming path, and the sibling-model bridge are all
    inherited untouched.
