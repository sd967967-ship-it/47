"""OpenRouter Text-to-Speech plugin (OpenAI Audio-Speech compatible).

One OpenRouter API key — the SAME ``openrouter_api_key`` the OpenRouter brain /
Jarvis-Agent providers already use — reaches every speech-synthesis model
OpenRouter hosts (Gemini Flash TTS, Grok Voice, Microsoft MAI-Voice, Mistral
Voxtral, Kokoro, Orpheus, Zonos, Sesame CSM, ...).

Endpoint (verified live 2026-07-02):
  ``POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/audio/speech`` — OpenAI-compatible.
  Body ``{"model","input","voice","response_format":"pcm"|"mp3","speed"?}``.
  ``response_format`` accepts ONLY ``"mp3"`` and ``"pcm"`` (``wav`` is rejected
  with a Zod validation error). We request ``pcm`` and the endpoint answers with
  ``Content-Type: audio/pcm;rate=24000;channels=1`` — raw 16-bit signed
  little-endian mono PCM at 24 kHz, i.e. EXACTLY the format the Jarvis playback
  pipeline consumes (same as Gemini / Grok / Cartesia), so no decode and no
  resample is needed. Streaming is real chunked-transfer over ``aiter_bytes``, so
  the first audio frame leaves as soon as the provider flushes it.

Error contract (open-source AP-22 resilience): a fatal error (missing key,
401/402/403/429, or a transport failure) is raised BEFORE the first
``AudioChunk`` is yielded. The provider-level ``FallbackTTS`` wrapper catches a
pre-first-chunk failure and crosses to the configured fallback voice, so a dead
/ keyless / rate-limited OpenRouter never bricks the TTS tier. Once audio has
started we re-raise rather than restart (no duplicated opening words).
