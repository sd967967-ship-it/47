"""Provider-level TTS fallback wrapper.

Honors the ``[tts].fallback`` config field, which was previously dead: the
factory built only the primary provider and nothing ever read ``fallback``.
That meant a primary-provider failure produced **total silence** instead of
degrading to the configured backup voice — the exact failure mode behind the
2026-05-31 "Jarvis hears + thinks but never answers" incident (a misconfigured
Vertex project raised inside ``GeminiFlashTTS._ensure_client`` on every
sentence, and there was no provider-level fallback for the gemini-flash-tts
primary; only ``GrokVoiceTTS`` had its own internal cross-provider chain).

``FallbackTTS`` wraps a primary provider and transparently switches to a
secondary provider when the primary cannot produce audio. This is the
``zero silent drops`` contract (AD-OE6) applied to the TTS layer.

Switch policy (deliberately conservative to never duplicate audio):
  - primary raises **before** yielding any chunk  -> use fallback
  - primary completes yielding **zero** chunks      -> use fallback
  - primary yields ≥1 chunk then raises             -> re-raise (cannot
    cleanly restart mid-utterance; falling back would replay the start)

The wrapper exposes exactly the surface the speech pipeline touches on a TTS
instance: ``synthesize(...)`` and ``_ensure_client()`` (called during warmup).
