"""On-device text-to-speech: Piper voices played through sherpa-onnx.

The speaking half of the local voice path — the first TTS in this repo that
needs no key and sends no text anywhere. Piper is the de-facto standard for
offline neural speech: small VITS voices exported to ONNX, real time on a
Raspberry Pi, and the only widely-used open family with genuine German voices
(Kokoro, the prettier alternative, ships nine languages and German is not one).

Two decisions worth stating, because both are easy to get wrong later:

**Licensing.** Piper's own runtime moved from MIT to GPL-3 in October 2025
(the project now lives at OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl). This repo is Apache-2.0, so the GPL
library is NOT used: the voices are plain ONNX files, and sherpa-onnx
(Apache-2.0) loads them. Do not "simplify" this by depending on piper1-gpl.

**One voice speaks one language.** Unlike a cloud TTS, a Piper voice is
monolingual. The pipeline resolves ONE output language per turn
(``resolve_output_language``) and hands it here as a BCP-47 code; this provider
maps it to the matching voice. That mapping is the whole reason the local voice
can honour the runtime-language doctrine instead of answering German text in an
English accent.
