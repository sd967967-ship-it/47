"""Where an installed skill came from.

A ``SKILL.md`` downloaded from the marketplace is byte-identical to one the
owner wrote: same frontmatter, same body, nothing in it says "installed". The
Skills view still has to be able to show it — so the install path drops a
small receipt next to the file, and the listing reads it back.

The receipt is a sidecar in the skill's own folder rather than a central index
because deleting the folder must delete the fact: a shared index would keep
claiming an origin for a skill that no longer exists, and two installs racing
would fight over one file. ``.marketplace.json`` starts with a dot and sits
beside ``SKILL.md``, not inside ``references/`` or ``scripts/``, so the loader's
resource scan never picks it up as bundle content.

Never raises: an unreadable or hand-mangled receipt costs the badge, never the
skill.
