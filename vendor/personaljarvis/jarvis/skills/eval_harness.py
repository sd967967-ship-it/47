"""Offline routing eval — provider-free, importable, CI-runnable.

The point of this module is that it calls **exactly** the functions the runtime
calls: :func:`jarvis.skills.match_eval.evaluate_match` for the decision and
:func:`jarvis.skills.guards.evaluate_guards` for the vetoes. A harness that
re-implements the algorithm measures the harness, not the product — and the
number it prints would drift away from reality without anyone noticing.

It replaces nothing: ``scripts/skill_routing_eval.py`` still measures the
LLM-judged path against a live provider, which is a different question. This
one measures the deterministic layer, needs no key, no network and no
``BrainManager``, and therefore can block a pull request.

Why both precision and recall, always, in the same report: the wake-word
subsystem twice destroyed its own recall while tightening precision, and the
collapse was invisible because only precision was being watched (AP-27). A
report that shows one number is how that happens again.
