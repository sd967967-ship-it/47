"""Read a SKILL.md that was not written for Jarvis.

The open Agent Skills format — the one `npx skills add` installs, and the one
Claude Code, Cursor, Codex and the rest consume — asks for two frontmatter
keys: ``name`` and ``description``. Everything beyond that is the publishing
agent's own vocabulary: ``allowed-tools``, ``model``, ``argument-hint``,
``metadata``, and whatever the next agent invents.

Jarvis' own :class:`~jarvis.skills.schema.SkillFrontmatter` is stricter and
sets ``extra="forbid"``, which is right for a skill Jarvis authors and wrong
for one it downloads: a single foreign key used to drop the whole file to
DRAFT, i.e. installed and dead. This module is the second reading, tried only
after the strict one failed — Postel's rule, applied at exactly one place.

Two properties make that safe rather than merely lenient:

* **Whitelist, not blacklist.** Only the fields listed in
  :data:`ADOPTED_FIELDS` are read. Everything else is dropped and *named* in
  the result, so a skill never silently gains a meaning nobody wrote.
* **Nothing that grants behaviour crosses over.** ``triggers`` (fires by
  itself), ``risk_policy`` (lowers the confirmation tier), ``auto_fire``
  (promotes into the matcher), ``execution`` (dispatches a background worker),
  ``requires_tools`` and the plugin-coupling fields are never adopted, even
  when a foreign file happens to spell them the way Jarvis does. A portable
  skill is instructions the assistant may follow — not a permission grant.

The strict schema stays the rule for skills written HERE: the authoring and
creator services validate against it unchanged, so a typo in a hand-written
skill is still caught where it is made.
