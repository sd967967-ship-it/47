"""Deterministic skill relevance — the paraphrase channel.

The gap this closes: a skill fires only when the user hits an author-written
regex verbatim, or when the router LLM happens to notice it among twenty
undifferentiated bullets. There is no *partial* match channel, so every
rephrasing falls through. This module is that channel.

It needs no model, no network and no new dependency, because **the corpus
already contains the vocabulary**: authors write their trigger regexes as lists
of literal phrases, quote real utterances inside ``when_to_use``, and fill
``intent_verbs`` / ``intent_objects`` with the German and Spanish nouns a user
actually says. The scorer mines what is already written rather than asking
anyone to re-author 22 builtin skills.

Design commitments, each load-bearing:

* **Stdlib only, pure CPU.** No LLM call, no disk access, no network — this sits
  on the voice hot path beside ~30 regex gates that cost 5-20 µs each (AP-9,
  AP-11). Typical query is ~75 µs at 50 skills.
* **O(len(utterance)), not O(len(skills)).** A posting list means installing
  more skills does not slow the hot path.
* **Corpus IDF, PLUS a closed function-word list.** IDF alone was the original
  design and it was measured to be insufficient here — see the comment above
  ``_FUNCTION_WORDS`` for the failure and the numbers. IDF still does the heavy
  lifting for domain terms that happen to be common across the installed set;
  the word list only covers the closed class IDF structurally cannot see.
* **Zero ``jarvis.*`` imports outside this package.** Skills are duck-typed via
  ``getattr`` exactly as ``prompt_injection.py`` and ``local_search.py`` do, so
  the module is trivially testable and cannot close an import cycle.

Deliberately NOT here: embeddings (a network round trip per query, or a ~90 MB
local model plus torch — both break the headless 1-vCPU floor and AP-26) and
stemming (a dependency or ~400 lines of per-language rules, needs language
detection we do not have on this path, and is hostile to German compounds,
which are the actual problem). Character trigrams do the same work in far less
code, language-agnostically.

Bands and thresholds are applied by :mod:`jarvis.skills.match_eval`; this module
only scores and reports where its own corpus-derived cut-offs lie. That keeps
the dependency one-directional.
