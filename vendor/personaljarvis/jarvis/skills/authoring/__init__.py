"""Skill-authoring pipeline (Phase 7.5).

Jarvis-Agent (frontier worker, Mission-Manager-orchestrated) generates new
skills on voice request. Welle-4 migration: previously Sub-Jarvis (Opus 4.7),
today Jarvis-Agent (see docs/jarvis-agents-bridge.md §11, R-6). Plan-§7.5:
strict-typed output via the `SkillDraft` Pydantic model, `state=draft`
enforcement on write (Plan-§AD-8), validation loop ≤3 retries,
an audit trail per authoring attempt.

Plan-§AP-6 (auto-activation forbidden): a generated skill is ALWAYS
written to the user-skills directory with `state=draft` — even if
the worker explicitly states `active` in the frontmatter.

# path (``creator_service`` -> ``authoring.service``). Load the runner lazily
# (PEP 562): the mission pipeline that actually uses it triggers the import on
# first attribute access, by which point the cycle is warm. ``.service``,
# ``.draft_writer`` and ``.schema`` carry no self_mod dependency and stay eager.
