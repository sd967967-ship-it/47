# Google Cloud via gcloud (not the browser)

When gcloud is connected, drive Google Cloud through the **`cli_gcloud`** tool —
headless, no browser login. This is the recipe for the common read tasks; it
does NOT replace the risk gate (resource-changing commands still confirm).

## Rules

- **Read-first.** List/describe before changing anything. Treat any command that
  creates, deletes, or modifies a resource as consequential — confirm first.
- **Non-interactive.** gcloud runs with prompts disabled; never wait on a `(y/N)`.
- **Honest on failure.** If a command exits non-zero (e.g. "billing API not
  enabled", "permission denied"), say exactly that — never invent a number.

## Costs / billing

```bash
gcloud billing accounts list --format=json
gcloud billing projects list --billing-account=<ACCOUNT_ID> --format=json
```

Billing detail needs the Cloud Billing API enabled and the right IAM role. If
either is missing the command fails — report the failure honestly, do not guess.

## Projects, compute, storage

```bash
gcloud projects list --format=json
gcloud compute instances list --format=json
gcloud storage buckets list --format=json
```

## IAM

```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy <PROJECT_ID> --format=json
```

Summarize the result for the user (account/project, amount + currency + period
for billing); omit raw ids unless asked.
