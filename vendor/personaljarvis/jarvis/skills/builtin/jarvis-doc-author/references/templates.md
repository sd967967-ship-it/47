# Templates, style canon, anti-patterns, quality checklist

Consolidated reference file. Contains:

1. **Templates** for all 6 doc types (concept, how-to, tutorial,
   reference, troubleshooting, adr) — copy-paste-ready skeletons.
2. **Style canon** — the 10 universal writing rules.
3. **Anti-patterns** AP-D-1..AP-D-12 — what a doc must NEVER do.
4. **Quality checklist** — 15-point self-check before saving.

## 1. Templates

Every template carries required sections (marked ``# REQUIRED``) and
optional sections (marked ``# OPTIONAL``). Delete non-applicable
optional sections entirely.

## 2. Style canon (10 universal rules)

Consolidated from Google + Microsoft + Write the Docs. When 3+ style guides
demand it in agreement, it is here — everything else is taste.

1. **Active voice.** "The ``EventBus`` emits the event" — not "The
   event is emitted".
2. **Imperative in instructions.** "Activate the voice pipeline" — not
   "We activate..." or "The voice pipeline can be activated".
3. **Du form (DE) / you (EN) — no "the user".** When the reader is meant,
   address them. "If you don't set the hotkey..." instead of "If
   the user doesn't set the hotkey...".
4. **Front-load the key takeaway.** First sentence per paragraph =
   conclusion. Justifications follow, not the other way around.
5. **Sentences < 25 words, median ~15.** Split complex sentences.
6. **Lists from 3+ items.** Bullet or numbered lists instead of comma prose.
7. **Code blocks ALWAYS with a language tag.** ``` ```python ```, ``` ```bash ```,
   ``` ```toml ```, ``` ```yaml ```, ``` ```json ```. Never bare
   triple backticks.
8. **Code identifiers in backticks.** ``BrainManager``, ``jarvis.toml``,
   ``EventBus`` — never italic, never unformatted.
9. **Spell out acronyms on first occurrence.** "Speech-to-Text (STT)"
   — STT OK after that.
10. **Consistent terminology.** One concept = one word. "Skill" OR
    "Plugin", not both for the same thing. If the term is already taken in
    Jarvis (see master plan / CLAUDE.md), adopt it.

**Bonus mandate for Jarvis** (not in the external style guides, derived
from user preferences in MEMORY.md):

- **Code identifiers in English, prose in English.** "The ``BrainManager`` builds
  a smart fallback chain." Not: "Der Hirn-Verwalter..." (Germanizing
  identifiers is forbidden). All doc prose is English per the output-language
  policy in ``CLAUDE.md``.

---

## 3. Anti-patterns (AP-D-1 to AP-D-12)

| ID | Anti-pattern | Why it's bad |
|---|---|---|
| **AP-D-1** | **Quadrant mix**: a tutorial contains a reference table of the API fields | Breaks Diataxis. The learner drowns; the fact-seeker overlooks it. |
| **AP-D-2** | **Concept doc with code snippets without context** | Snippets without a tutorial / how-to frame have no purpose. |
| **AP-D-3** | **Tutorial with options** ("you can also use X") | A tutorial must be linear. Options confuse learners — they belong in a how-to. |
| **AP-D-4** | **Reference without examples** | A bare signature is not enough. 1 mini example per entry is mandatory. |
| **AP-D-5** | **How-to without a prerequisites section** | The reader crashes at step 3 because step 0 was implicit. |
| **AP-D-6** | **Stale doc without ``status: deprecated``** | The doc describes a non-existent feature → more trust-damaging than a missing doc. |
| **AP-D-7** | **Owner field empty or ``owner: tbd``** | The doc rots because nobody feels responsible. |
| **AP-D-8** | **Slug changes on rename** | Breaks all cross-refs. The slug is append-only — the title may change. |
| **AP-D-9** | **Frontmatter drift** between sibling docs (different fields per file) | Tooling breaks, the search/filter index becomes unusable. |
| **AP-D-10** | **"Obviously" / "simply" / "just"** | Humiliates failing readers; Microsoft + Apple + Google explicitly forbid it. |
| **AP-D-11** | **"Click here" / "see this link"** as link text | The link text must describe the target: "see ``ADR-0011``", not "see here". |
| **AP-D-12** | **A concept explained twice in different places** | Drift guaranteed. One place explains, all others link. |
| **AP-D-13** | **Frontmatter ``title`` too long (>60 characters)** — gets truncated in sidebar/recent/search results | User mandate 2026-04-29: the complete wording must be readable in the DocsView sidebar. The long explanation belongs in the body H1, not in the display title. Max 50 characters recommended. |

**Plus 5 Jarvis-specific anti-patterns** (derived from the master-plan
mandates):

| ID | Anti-pattern | Why it's bad |
|---|---|---|
| **AP-J-1** | **How-to without a verification section** | Violates the verify-before-ship mandate (CLAUDE.md §0). The doc delivers steps but no test. |
| **AP-J-2** | **Germanized code identifier** ("der Hirn-Verwalter" instead of ``BrainManager``) | Breaks the user preference. Identifiers are standard Python English. |
| **AP-J-3** | **Voice example without a language tag** ("Jarvis, mach X" — without a hint whether DE or EN) | Bilingual default means both are equivalent — the example must be clearly attributed. |
| **AP-J-4** | **TODO/FIXME/TBD in the body when ``status: active``** | If it's a stub: ``status: draft`` in the frontmatter — otherwise the status lies. |
| **AP-J-5** | **Filler intro** ("Welcome to this document about X.") | Breaks the 1-2-sentence intro standard. Get straight to the point. |

## 4. Quality checklist (15 points)

Before the file is written, go through all 15 points. ``M`` =
machine-checkable, ``A`` = eye check.

### Structure (Diataxis lock)

1. ``M`` — Frontmatter complete: are all 7 required fields set?
2. ``A`` — Does the doc serve exactly **one** Diataxis quadrant? No
   tutorial-with-reference appendices?
3. ``M`` — H1 = ``title`` from the frontmatter? Exactly one H1 per file?
4. ``M`` — Heading hierarchy consistent? No H4 under H2 without an H3?

### Language (style canon)

5. ``A`` — Active voice in at least 80% of the sentences?
6. ``A`` — Imperative in how-to / tutorial steps? No "we" in a how-to?
7. ``A`` — Sentences predominantly < 25 words?
8. ``A`` — Acronyms spelled out on first occurrence?
9. ``A`` — Code identifiers in backticks, prose in English?

### Content (quadrant-specific)

10. ``A`` — Tutorial: mid-point check after every phase? No options?
11. ``A`` — How-to: prerequisites section at the top? Verification section
    at the bottom?
12. ``A`` — Reference: every entry with ≥ 1 mini example?
13. ``A`` — Explanation: ≥ 1 diagram/table/trade-off section OR an
    explicit "why this way and not another" section?

### Reliability

14. ``M`` — Do code blocks have a language tag (``bash``, ``python``,
    ``toml`` etc.)?
15. ``M`` — Cross-links as relative paths? No ``https://github.com/...``
    links to the own repo?

### Bonus (if available, otherwise skip)

- ``M`` — Readability: Flesch reading ease ≥ 50 (developer audience)?
  (Tool: ``py-readability-metrics``.)
- ``M`` — Dead-link check clean? (Tool: ``lychee`` or
  ``markdown-link-check``.)
- ``M`` — Doc coverage: if a reference covers the public API → is the API
  fully described? (Tool: a custom pytest against ``entry_points``.)

When all 15 required points are green: the file can be written.
If one is red: fix it first, don't make excuses with "almost done".

---

## Application (quick workflow)

When writing a new doc:

1. **Decide the quadrant** (see ``diataxis-quadrants.md``).
2. **Copy the template from this file** (section 1).
3. **Fill in the frontmatter** (see ``frontmatter-schema.md``).
4. **Write the body** observing the style canon (section 2).
5. **Go through the anti-patterns** (section 3) — what did I almost
   commit?
6. **Work through the quality checklist** (section 4) — all 15 green?
7. **Write the file.**

Steps 5 and 6 together take about 2-3 minutes — the cheapest quality lever
in the entire docs pipeline.
