r"""Built-in skills for Jarvis.

Each subdirectory contains exactly one `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
(see `jarvis.skills.schema.SkillFrontmatter`). On first run these skills are
copied into `user_skills_dir()` by
`jarvis.skills.bootstrap.ensure_user_skills_dir()` (Windows:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Jarvis\skills`) — the `SkillRegistry` reads from and watches
that location.

List of bundled skills:
  - morning-routine   calendar / mail / weather morning briefing
  - deep-work-mode    DND + focus timer via hotkey/voice
  - memory-save       "remember that ..." saved to memory-MCP
  - skill-creator     meta-skill for building further skills
  - plugin-<id>       Paired skills for marketplace plugins (2026-06-07): each
                      teaches the router which voice/chat intents reach the
                      connected plugin's tools (gmail, github, stripe, ...).
