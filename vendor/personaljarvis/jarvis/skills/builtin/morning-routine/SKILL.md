# Morning Routine

Deliver a short spoken morning briefing — an overview of the day in under
30 seconds. No walls of text, no reading out 20 emails. Work through the
steps below with the tools you actually have; skip a step gracefully
(one short clause, e.g. "calendar is not connected yet") when its
integration is unavailable. Never invent data.

## Steps

1. **Calendar.** If a calendar plugin or tool is connected (e.g. a
   `google-calendar/...` tool), fetch today's events
   ({{ config.calendar_days_ahead }} day ahead).
   - 0 events: say the calendar is free today.
   - 1 event: name it with its time.
   - Several: give the count and the next one with its time.
   - If the next event starts within 60 minutes, add a heads-up.

2. **Email.** If the Gmail plugin is connected (tools namespaced
   `gmail/...`), check unread mail (limit {{ config.email_limit }}).
   - 0 unread: "inbox is empty".
   - Up to 3: mention sender and subject briefly.
   - More: give the count and the 1-2 most important senders.
   Never read full bodies; never read out secrets or codes.

3. **Weather.** If a web search tool is available, get today's weather for
   {{ config.weather_location }} ({{ config.weather_format }}). One clause:
   condition, high/low. Skip silently if unavailable.

4. **Anything urgent.** If a running mission or an unread important
   notification is visible to you, mention it in one sentence.

## Answer format

Compose ONE flowing, friendly briefing of 3-5 short sentences — natural
spoken language, no lists, no markdown, no tool names. End with the most
actionable item (e.g. the next appointment). Answer in the user's
language.
