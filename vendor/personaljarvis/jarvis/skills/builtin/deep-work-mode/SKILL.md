description: >-
  Activates a distraction-free focus sprint: quiet notifications where
  possible, focus music if Spotify is connected, and a clear spoken start
  signal with the sprint duration. Use when the user wants to focus,
  start deep work, or enter concentration mode.
when_to_use: >-
  Use when the user says "fokusmodus", "starte fokus", "deep work mode",
  "konzentrationsmodus", "aktiviere deep work", or presses the focus
  hotkey. Not for a casual "ich muss mich konzentrieren" remark without a
  clear activation intent.

# intent_verbs stays absent on purpose — plugin_coupling requires verbs AND
# objects to register a capability, so this feeds ONLY the matcher.

# Deep Work Mode

Start a {{ config.duration_minutes }}-minute focus sprint with as little
friction as possible — the user is mid context switch, so act, don't
interrogate. Use only capabilities that are actually available; skip the
rest with one short clause. Never invent actions you did not perform.

## Steps

1. **Quiet the desktop.** If a do-not-disturb or notification control
   capability is available on this machine, enable it for
   {{ config.duration_minutes }} minutes. If none is available, tell the
   user in one clause that notifications must be muted manually.

2. **Focus music.** If the Spotify plugin is connected (tools namespaced
   `spotify/...`), start the "{{ config.spotify_playlist }}" playlist.
   Otherwise skip silently.

3. **Status.** If the Slack plugin is connected (tools namespaced
   `slack/...`), set the user's status to focused with an end time
   {{ config.duration_minutes }} minutes from now. Otherwise skip
   silently.

## Answer format

One short spoken confirmation: what was activated and for how long —
e.g. that the sprint runs for {{ config.duration_minutes }} minutes and
what was muted or started. One sentence, no list, no tool names. Answer
in the user's language.
