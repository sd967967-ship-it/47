when_to_use: Use when the user wants music — start a song, artist, album or playlist, pause, skip, go back, change the volume, queue something up, or ask what is playing right now.

  # Play-verb + a music noun ("play a song" / "Lied abspielen") — the bare
  # noun is not a trigger (a question about a song is not a play request).
  # Generic capture lands here, then music_service swaps to the preferred
  # connected connector.

Use the connected Spotify to play and steer the user's music.

- Play by name, not by id: pass what the user said as `query` and set `type` to what they meant — `track` for a song, `artist` for a band, `album`, or `playlist` for "my running playlist". The tool searches and plays the top hit in one step.
- "Play" with no name resumes what is paused. Do not search for something to fill the gap.
- Say what actually started. The result carries the track and artist Spotify matched, which is often not literally what the user said — reporting it is how they catch a wrong hit immediately.
- Spotify plays through a device, not through this app. If nothing is open anywhere, say exactly that and offer to open Spotify — do not report it as an error or a broken connection. When several devices are idle, ask which one instead of picking.
- Controlling playback needs Spotify Premium. On that refusal, name it as Spotify's rule and stay useful: reading what is playing still works on a free account.
- Volume is a percentage from 0 to 100. "Quieter" is a step down from the current level, not a jump to zero — read the state first if you do not know it.
