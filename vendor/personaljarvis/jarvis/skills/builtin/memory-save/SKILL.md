  DEPRECATED since B5 (2026-05-13) and disabled. Long-term-memory writes
  go through the wiki pipeline (Awareness layer, SessionRollupWorker,
  WikiCurator). Use when nothing — this skill must not be re-enabled;
  "merk dir" phrases belong to the normal brain pipeline.
when_to_use: >-
  Use when never — kept on disk only as a reference until the B4 hard-cut
  deletes it. Re-enabling it would hijack the B5 wiki path.

# Memory Save (deprecated)

Historical behavior, for reference only: the user stated a fact
("merk dir: X" / "remember this: X"), the trigger captured the tail as
`content`, and the fact was persisted into core memory with a one-word
spoken confirmation. That entire flow now lives in the brain pipeline
plus the wiki tier (`wiki-ingest` for deterministic saves) — do not
rebuild it here.
