"""Context registry for the skill system (skills-brain integration).

Modeled on: ``jarvis/harness/computer_use_context.py``.

The speech pipeline (pre-brain hook) and the ``run_skill`` tool need
access to SkillRegistry + SkillRunner. Both components are instantiated at
different places (BrainManager factory vs. pipeline bootstrap), and the
plugin tools are loaded via ``entry_points`` without args. Instead of
threading cumbersome DI through every layer, we keep
a process-wide context.

The app calls ``set_skill_context(ctx)`` once at startup; consumers
fetch the context with ``get_skill_context()`` (raises RuntimeError
if not set) or ``try_get_skill_context()`` (None if not
set — for optional hooks that can gracefully skip).
