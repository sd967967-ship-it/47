"""Persistent setup-state flags for first-run heuristics (Phase B9.7).

A tiny JSON-backed key/value store used by the Desktop App to decide
whether a one-shot wizard has already been completed for the current
user. The only consumer today is the Obsidian Setup Dialog
(:mod:`jarvis.ui.web.setup_routes`), which auto-opens on the first
visit to the Wiki tab when Obsidian is not yet wired up — but only
once. After the user dismisses the wizard with the explicit "Hat
geklappt" button, the flag ``obsidian_setup_seen_at`` is set and the
dialog never auto-opens again. The user can still re-open it manually
from the status pill.

Scope of this module:
  * One file on disk: ``<repo-root>/data/setup_state.json``, anchored to
    the installed package (NOT ``os.getcwd()`` — the runtime CWD is not a
    reliable repo-root and a CWD-relative path re-showed the first-run guide
    on every restart).
  * Pure functional API — no singletons, no background threads, no
    event-bus integration.
  * Atomic writes via the same tempfile + ``os.replace`` pattern used
    by :func:`jarvis.setup.obsidian.register_vault`.

What this module deliberately does NOT do:
  * No schema validation — keys are free-form. The Obsidian wizard
    uses ``obsidian_setup_seen_at`` (ISO-8601 UTC string). Future
    wizards may add their own keys without coordination.
  * No file-locking. Concurrent writes from two Jarvis instances
    would race; the atomic ``os.replace`` guarantees the file is
    never corrupt, but the loser's update is discarded. That is
    acceptable for one-shot first-run flags.
  * No corruption recovery. A malformed JSON file is silently
    treated as an empty state — the next ``mark_*`` call will
    overwrite it. Logging the parse error here would be noisy; the
    flags are not load-bearing.
