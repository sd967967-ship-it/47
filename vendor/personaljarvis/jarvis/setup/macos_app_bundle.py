"""Build the managed-install macOS app identity (BUG-060).

The bundle's main executable must remain a Mach-O process. A shell launcher
that ``exec``s an external virtual-environment Python loses its ``NSBundle``
identity and causes TCC grants to attach to Python or a terminal instead of
Personal Jarvis. The managed installer therefore compiles the in-repo stub
launcher (``macos_stub_launcher.c``): it embeds the active Python runtime in
the app process and runs the managed entry script, so it works with framework
AND non-framework interpreters (for example uv-managed standalone builds)
while the source and dependencies remain in the managed checkout.

The locally generated app is signed with the per-user code-signing identity
from ``macos_signing_identity`` whenever one exists. macOS then pins the TCC
grants to ``identifier + certificate`` instead of to the code-directory hash,
so the bundle can be rebuilt as often as needed without losing a single
permission. Without that identity (no GUI session at install time, the user
declined the one trust dialog) the app falls back to an ad-hoc signature and
is preserved byte-for-byte on ordinary source updates so its identity does
not churn. When the TCC identity does change (ad-hoc rebuild, or the one-time
migration from ad-hoc to the certificate), macOS orphans every previously
recorded grant — the old rows then read as silently DENIED for the "new" app
and macOS never prompts again (BUG-083). After such a change this module
resets the stale TCC rows for our bundle id via ``tccutil`` so the app can
prompt fresh. Public binary distribution still requires the separate
Developer-ID signing and notarization pipeline; this module never claims a
locally signed app is a notarized artifact.
