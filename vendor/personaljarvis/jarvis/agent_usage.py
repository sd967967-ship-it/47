"""How much of each connected subscription is already spent.

A user who holds several seats of the same coding CLI
(:mod:`jarvis.agent_accounts`) can switch which one the next terminal opens
against — but until now the one number that decides WHICH seat to pick was
invisible here. The plan limits (Claude's rolling 5-hour window and its 7-day
window, Codex's weekly window) were only ever readable by starting the CLI and
typing its own status command, once per seat, in a pane that then had to be
thrown away. This module answers the same question for every registered seat at
once, without opening anything.

**Per account, never "this machine".** The reader is handed ONE account
directory and reports on exactly that login, the same narrow question
:func:`jarvis.agent_accounts.describe` asks. A cross-directory search would be
actively misleading here: it would paint one seat's remaining budget onto a
neighbouring row, and the whole point of the feature is deciding between rows.

**Live first, cached second, and it always says which.** Both CLIs cache their
last known limits on disk, and that cache is genuinely useful — it survives an
expired token and needs no network. It is also, for an idle seat, arbitrarily
old: a weekly window that reads 40% may have been written four days ago. So a
reading carries its ``source`` and its ``as_of``, and the UI states them.
Presenting a stale number as a live one is the single worst outcome here,
because it is the number the user is about to make a decision on.

**Nothing is ever spawned and no token ever leaves.** Usage is one small HTTPS
GET against the provider the account is already signed in to, plus a few file
reads. The bearer is read from the account's own credential file, used for that
one request, and never returned, never logged, never written anywhere.

Cross-platform by construction: ``pathlib`` throughout, no OS branch, and every
failure path — no network, no login, an unknown CLI, a provider that changed its
payload — degrades to an honest "not available" with a reason rather than to a
confident wrong percentage.
