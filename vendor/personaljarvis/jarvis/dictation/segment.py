"""Where to cut a dictation recording into transcribable segments.

Why segmenting matters at all: transcribing the whole growing buffer on every
tick costs O(n²) in audio seconds and, on a metered API, real money — a
two-minute dictation re-sends the entire recording roughly a hundred times.
Closing segments as they finish turns that into one pass over the audio.

Why cutting is not trivial: a cut in the middle of a word produces two wrong
transcriptions instead of one right one, and the damage is permanent because a
closed segment is never re-transcribed. So the cut point is not "exactly at N
seconds" but "at the quietest moment near N seconds" — which, in dictated
speech, is a pause between words far more often than not.

A second job lives here: deciding that a stretch of audio holds no speech at
all, so it is never uploaded. Silence is not free — every silent second costs a
transcription request, and a request over silence is the single most reliable
way to make Whisper invent a sentence ("Thank you for watching", subtitle
credits, and friends). A user who pauses to think therefore paid twice: once in
rate limit, once in fabricated words landing in their text.

Judged on ENERGY only, never on what came back as text. That is the same rule
the wake path learned the hard way (AP-27): a content test cannot separate a
hallucination from a real utterance, because both are just words.

Pure functions over raw PCM: no model, no VAD state machine, no I/O. The VAD
proper is deliberately not reused here — it is a stateful component on the
voice hot path, and dictation must never contend with it.
