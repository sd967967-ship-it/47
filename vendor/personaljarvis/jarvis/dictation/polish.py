"""The dictation polish pass — a second, generative formatting stage.

What it is
----------
The deterministic cleanup (:mod:`jarvis.dictation.cleanup`) can delete a
hesitation sound and repair the space it left behind. It cannot put a sentence
back together: it cannot punctuate, cannot repair the capital letter a
transcription segment boundary broke every ~8 seconds, cannot resolve "at 2,
actually 3" into "at 3", and cannot turn a spoken enumeration into a list. No
amount of regex closes that gap — a second generative pass does, and the market
reference tool's own published architecture confirms that is how they close it.

Two jobs, one pass
------------------
The same machinery also runs the TRANSLATE pass (``[dictation].translate``),
which delivers the dictation in a fixed language whatever the speaker used. It
is the same chain, the same breaker, the same ceiling and the same fail-open
contract — the prompt (:mod:`jarvis.dictation.translate_prompt`), the guard set
(``translate_drift_reason``) and the model TIER
(:attr:`~jarvis.dictation.polish_client.PolishFamily.translate_model`) differ,
and formatting happens inside the SAME call so a translation costs one round
trip, not two. ``translate_to`` selects the mode;
:func:`resolve_translate_target` decides it.

Precision mode rides on top of both
-----------------------------------
``[dictation].polish_precision`` licenses ONE further step in either pass:
replacing a word with a more precise one that means the same thing. It is a
prompt clause (:func:`jarvis.dictation.polish_prompt.precision_block`, shared by
both prompts so the switch means one thing) plus a matched guard
(``precision_drift_reason``), and the two must always travel together — the
ordinary guard rejects a substitution as ``lost_term``, which is the answer this
mode is built to produce. That guard trade is why it ships OFF: everything else
in this module can be defaulted on because it only ever costs a formatting pass,
and this one costs a check.

The contract, in one sentence
-----------------------------
**This pass can only ever be a no-op; it can never be a loss.**
:attr:`PolishOutcome.text` starts life as the raw transcript and is replaced
only after every deterministic guard in :mod:`jarvis.dictation.polish_guards`
has passed. :func:`polish_transcript` never raises on a failure of its own — it
catches ``Exception`` — and every failure path returns the user's own words with
a status that says what happened. It deliberately does NOT catch
``BaseException``: ``SystemExit``, ``KeyboardInterrupt`` and ``CancelledError``
are the process being told to stop, not a formatting failure, and turning one of
them into a ``provider_error`` would leave a task that refuses to die.

Four things bound it
--------------------
1. **A hard latency ceiling.** One ``asyncio.wait_for`` around the WHOLE pass —
   the credential sweep included, since that is exactly where a locked keyring
   blocks — default 1200 ms, ramping with the transcript's length up to
   ``polish_timeout_max_ms`` (see :data:`_TIMEOUT_FREE_WORDS`). On expiry the
   in-flight work is cancelled and the raw text is delivered. A formatter that
   makes the user wait has already failed at its job; a ceiling that cancels
   the pass on every long dictation has failed at its own.
2. **A key-aware, family-crossing chain** (:func:`resolve_polish_chain`,
   AP-22). No key in any family means an empty chain, status ``unavailable``,
   and behaviour byte-identical to before this feature existed — the AP-23
   gate: the maintainer's credentials must never be what makes the default
   safe.
3. **A privacy floor.** When the configured recognizer transcribes on this
   machine, the chain never crosses to a cloud family on its own; if no local
   model answers, the status is ``local_only`` and the raw text is delivered.
   The user can still opt in by pinning a cloud ``polish_provider``.
4. **A circuit breaker.** Three consecutive provider errors or timeouts open it
   for 120 s, after which the pass short-circuits to ``unavailable`` without
   dialling out. A dead provider must not add 1.2 s to every dictation.

Nothing blocks the event loop
-----------------------------
The chain resolution walks up to seven credential slots and reads the config
file. On a Linux desktop with a locked keyring or a slow D-Bus Secret Service
that blocks for seconds, and on the event loop it would take the microphone
drain task, the WebSocket and the Jarvis Bar down with it — the same shape as
the ``load_config`` freeze in the bug register. So it runs in a worker thread,
inside the ceiling, and its answer is cached against
:func:`polish_chain_fingerprint`: one sweep per settings change, not one per
dictation.

AP-26: nothing here is imported at module scope by the speech pipeline. The
pipeline imports this module INSIDE ``_finish_dictation``, exactly the way it
already imports ``clean_transcript``, and ``httpx`` / ``google-genai`` are
imported deeper still — inside client construction, on the first dictation,
never at boot.

# ``polish_timeout_ms`` used to be the whole budget, whatever was dictated. That
# is a promise about the WAIT, applied to work whose size the user chose: the
# model has to write the finished text out, so a transcript ten times as long
# takes materially longer, and a single ceiling therefore switches the feature
# off on exactly the dictations it was most needed for. Measured on one live
# install (2026-08-20, 201 wording passes, the shipped 1200 ms ceiling): the
# passes that succeeded ran 526 ms median under 25 words and 850-1000 ms at
# 100-220 words, while the 20 that expired had a median of 77 words against 15
# for the ones that came back. Ten per cent of the pass was being thrown away
# by the clock, and it was the long half.
#
# So the ceiling ramps with the transcript instead. Below the free allowance
# nothing changes at all — the one-line dictation keeps exactly the budget it
# always had. Above it, each further word buys a few more milliseconds, up to a
# hard cap the user sets.
#
# The two numbers are read off that same live install rather than guessed. The
# allowance is 25 words because the p90 at 25-49 words was already 992 ms
# against a 1200 ms ceiling — the wall is met far earlier than "long dictation"
# suggests, and a translation, which has to write every word again in another
# language, meets it earlier still. The rate is ~3x the measured slope
# (2.7 ms/word formatting, 4.4 ms/word translating), because the ceiling exists
# to cut off a provider that has DIED, not to race a healthy one having a slow
# minute.
#
# **A wider ceiling does not make dictation slower.** The model answers when it
# answers — 570-870 ms on the measured runs — and the ceiling is only ever
# reached when the provider is struggling. What it changes is what happens
# THERE: waiting an extra second, or dropping German text into an English
# document. The old ceiling chose the second one nine times out of ten it was
# hit, and never said so.

    this decision is how one recording ends up translated by one button and not
    by the other.

    **It reads the CONFIG and nothing else.** That is the whole design, and it

    confidently reports German dictations as English), so with an English target
    a mislabelled dictation silently kept its German — and the user watched

    the wait after key release flat). It reaches the model as a delimited
    context block — style only, never repeated — and the guards still judge
    *raw* against the answer alone. Ignored in translate mode.

    ``language`` is the ALREADY-RESOLVED transcript language (the pipeline
    resolves it before it gets here); it steers the guards and appears in the
    prompt only as a weak, explicitly-unreliable hint. ``protected_terms`` are
    spellings the model may not "correct" — the STT dictionary, the wake word,
    the user's name. ``timeout_s`` overrides the configured ceiling; it exists
    for tests and for the settings-screen dry run.

    ``translate_to`` switches the pass into TRANSLATE mode: the text comes back
    in that language, cleaned up, and the status is ``translated`` rather than
    ``applied``. It is an already-resolved target code — the caller decides
    whether a translation is wanted at all

    double the latency of a pass that sits between the key release and the words

    The contract is unchanged in both modes, with one honest caveat. This pass
    can still only ever be a no-op: on a timeout, a dead provider, a missing key
    or a failed guard the user gets their own words back. But in translate mode
    a no-op is *visible* — the text arrives in the language it was spoken in —
    where a skipped polish is merely unpunctuated. That is why the status is
