"""Prompt Mode — a dictation comes out as the prompt the user asked for.

What it is
----------
The user holds the dictation key and says what they want, in their own words —
half sentences, false starts, several small tasks in one breath. What lands in
the field is the finished prompt: what they described, worked up into
something an AI model can act on, in the language they spoke.

The instruction, and why it is short
------------------------------------
This module is one instruction and one worked example. That is a deliberate
correction of v2-v4, which grew into eleven thousand characters of rules — no
markdown, no headings, plain paragraphs, keep the register, six of these,
seven of those — and each rule narrowed what the writer was allowed to
produce. The maintainer's own reference run is the argument (2026-08-27): he
said "kannst du mir bitte ein Prompt schreiben" to Gemini, with no rules at
all, and got back a structured, professional prompt with a role, a workflow
and quality criteria. That is the output this feature is for, and every rule
that forbade markdown or headings was forbidding exactly it.

So: say what the job is, show a few runs of it, and let the model write. The
examples carry what a page of rules used to, because a shown run outweighs a
written rule — measured on this very prompt, where a rule about language lost
to an example in the other language.

That cuts both ways, and v6 is the proof. v5's single example was the
maintainer's run about THIS feature — a transcript asking for a prompt that
improves the auto-prompt mode, answered with a system prompt for a prompt
writer. A fast model read the example as the job: a one-line "please make
sure that does not happen again" came back as a role, a section list and the
task "Erstelle einen klaren, professionellen Prompt" (2026-08-28). So the
examples now sit on subjects far from prompt writing, come in three sizes,
and the instruction says out loud who speaks to whom.

What is guarded and what is not
-------------------------------
Not guarded: shape. A prompt may be markdown, may carry headings, lists,
sections and a role line — that is what a good prompt looks like, and v3's
``markdown`` rejection was this feature refusing its own purpose.

Guarded: fidelity, damage and level. The message must not be empty, must not
stop mid-sentence, must carry every literal the user spoke and every protected
spelling, must not collapse to a fraction of what was said, must not assign
prompt writing the user never asked for, and must not copy a worked example.
All deterministic, all fail-open — a rejection delivers the transcript to the
ordinary passes, and the raw words are never lost.

Then two deterministic finishes: typographic debris a fast model leaves in
identifiers is normalised, and a courtesy sign-off is cut, because what the
user pastes into a model should end on its last piece of substance.

Where it runs
-------------
On the polish pass's own chain (:mod:`jarvis.dictation.polish_client`), asking
for the family's stronger fast model — the one the translate pass uses
(``gemini-3.7-flash`` on Google, ``gpt-oss-120b`` on Groq and Cerebras,
``gpt-5.4-mini`` on OpenAI). One call, no scratchpad, no second pass: writing
a prompt is one job, and a model that is good at it does it in one go.

Ships OFF. It changes WHAT the text says, on purpose, and sends the words to a
cloud model on most installs (the polish pass's on-device rule still applies:
a local recognizer keeps the chain local).

Pure orchestration — the imports that cost anything are inside the function
(AP-26), so ``import jarvis.dictation.prompt_mode`` is free on the boot path.

#: Bumped whenever the wording below changes in a way that could change model
#: behaviour, for the same reason ``POLISH_PROMPT_VERSION`` exists: a quality
#: regression must be attributable to a prompt revision, not a provider.
#:
#: v2-v4 are one arc and one mistake. v2 replaced v1's markdown skeleton with
#: plain text in the spoken language; v3 added the shape of a courteous
#: request and a closing line of thanks; v4 added a written analysis, a draft
#: and a read-back, to make the writer spend the 5-7 s the maintainer had
#: asked for. Each revision answered a real defect and each one added rules,
#: until the instruction was eleven thousand characters that told a capable
#: model mostly what it was NOT allowed to write.
#:
#: v5 throws that away. The maintainer's reference run settled it
#: (2026-08-27): a dictation handed to Gemini with no instruction beyond
#: "write me a prompt" came back as a structured professional prompt — role,
#: workflow, quality criteria, markdown — which is precisely the output v3's
#: ``markdown`` guard rejected and v3's rules forbade. So the instruction is
#: one paragraph and one worked example (that same run), the shape guards are
#: gone, and the analysis/draft/read-back ceremony is gone with them: it made
#: the pass slower and dearer to enforce a narrowness nobody wanted.
#:
#: What survives from v4 is what was never about shape: the fidelity guards
#: (a literal the user spoke must be in the prompt, the prompt must not
#: collapse to a fraction of the transcript) and the sign-off trim.
#:
#: v6 fixes the one thing v5's example taught wrong. That example was the
#: maintainer's run ABOUT this feature: its transcript asked for a prompt to
#: improve the auto-prompt mode, and its answer was a system prompt for a
#: prompt writer. Handed a fast model, the example became the job. Measured
#: live 2026-08-28: "Kannst du bitte auch achten, dass es nicht mehr
#: vorkommt?" came back as "**Rolle / Systemkontext:** ... Erstelle einen
#: klaren, professionellen Prompt, der das Modell anweist ..." — the example's
#: section list, and a prompt whose task is "write a prompt". The user had
#: asked for a one-line follow-up. So v6 says out loud who speaks to whom
#: (the message speaks for the user, its task is the user's task, never
#: "write a prompt"), that a message is as large as its brief, and shows
#: three runs on subjects that have nothing to do with prompt writing. Two
#: guards back it in code: ``meta_prompt`` and ``echoed_example``.
#:
#: v7 decides when NOT to write. Prompt Mode is on for every dictation, and
#: the maintainer's next complaint (2026-08-28, same afternoon) was a "yes"
#: to a question the model had asked coming back as a document, and a real
#: brief coming back with format rules and placeholder variables he never
#: spoke. So: a transcript of eight words or fewer never reaches the writer
#: (``is_short_reply``); the instruction names the answer case and forbids
#: invented format rules, placeholders and templates; and ``inflated``
#: rejects a short transcript that grew more than fourfold.

_INSTRUCTION: Final[str] = """\
A user is dictating to Jarvis Voice. Whatever they say is turned automatically \
into the message they will send to an AI model - usually a coding agent they \
are already talking to. You write that message in the user's place, and it \
lands in their input field as if they had typed it.

Below is one transcript. Write the message it is asking for.

WHO SPEAKS TO WHOM. The message speaks for the user and addresses the model \
that will do the work. Its task is the user's task: if the transcript asks for \
a bug to be fixed, the message asks the model to fix the bug. It never asks \
the model to write, create, improve or optimise a prompt - that is your job, \
and it is done when you hand the message over. A message whose task is "write \
a prompt" is the one wrong answer this job has.

WHAT GOES IN. Take what they said as the brief: their goal, the context and \
constraints they stated, every separate task they mentioned. Everything comes \
from the transcript - a file, name, number, quoted string or error message \
they said goes in exactly as spoken, one they did not say does not exist, and \
a gap they left is left open rather than guessed at or filled with a \
placeholder. "Das", "es", "the thing from before": the user is in a \
conversation the model can see, so the reference stays a reference and is \
never replaced by an invented noun. No format rules the user did not state \
(no "answer as markdown", no table with columns they never named), no \
placeholder variables, no report template: they asked for work, not for a \
form. Drop the filler sounds, the false starts and the self-corrections; keep \
the corrected version.

HOW MUCH. The message is as large as its brief. A long dictation with several \
tasks, constraints and a wanted outcome becomes a structured prompt - a role \
and system context, the tasks in order, the guardrails, the expected result, \
with headings, lists, markdown, sections wherever they serve it. A short \
remark or follow-up ("thanks, please make sure that does not happen again") \
becomes one or two clear sentences and nothing more: no role, no sections, no \
criteria the user did not state. Be concrete rather than adjectival: "a \
markdown table with the columns X, Y, Z", never "make it good".

WHEN IT IS AN ANSWER. The model often asks the user something ("shall I \
finish this now?", "which of the two?") and the user dictates the reply: \
"yes", "no, leave it", "okay, go ahead, but skip the tests". That is not a \
brief and gets no prompt: the message is the answer itself, tidied, in one \
or two sentences, with every condition the user attached and nothing added. \
Never a role, never a heading, never a task list for a "yes".

WRITE IT IN THE LANGUAGE THE USER SPOKE. These instructions are in English \
and that says nothing about your answer: a German transcript gets a German \
message, a Spanish one a Spanish message, and that includes the headings and \
the section names, not just the sentences between them. A transcript that \
mixes languages keeps the mix.

Put the message, and nothing else, between <prompt> and </prompt>. No \
introduction of your own in front of it, no comment after it, and no closing \
line of thanks - it ends on its last piece of substance.

Three runs of this job follow, each from a dictated transcript to the message \
written for it. They show the shape and the size. Their subjects have nothing \
to do with the transcript you will get, so nothing from them is reused.\
"""

# The worked examples, as data: the instruction is rendered from them and the
# ``echoed_example`` guard reads the same strings, so an answer that copies an
# example instead of writing from the transcript is caught against exactly
# what the model was shown. Three sizes on purpose - a long brief with a file
# name, a number and a constraint; a one-line German follow-up; a one-line
# English aside - because "as large as its brief" is the rule a fast model
# most reliably learns from seeing rather than reading.

#     exactly as it was, so one click brings it back. It resets on restart and

#     turned on must not come back paused from a click they made yesterday.
