"""Put dictated text into the focused field of the foreground application.

The one rule this module exists to enforce
------------------------------------------
**The text is on the clipboard before the first keystroke is emitted, and it
stays there if the paste fails.**

Insertion — not speech recognition — is where a dictation feature actually
breaks, and it breaks *silently* in at least three independent ways:

* **Windows UIPI.** A non-elevated process cannot send synthetic input to a
  window owned by a higher-integrity process. Microsoft documents that a
  ``SendInput`` blocked this way reports failure through neither its return
  value nor ``GetLastError`` — so the paste vanishes and the call reports
  success (measured on a live desktop, 2026-07-02).
* **macOS Secure Input.** A password field calls ``EnableSecureEventInput``;
  while it is on, keyboard events stop reaching other processes.
* **Wayland.** Synthetic input is blocked by design; there is no in-process
  route at all.

None of these produce an error we could catch after the fact, and verifying by
reading the target field back needs the accessibility tree — which is blocked in
exactly the cases that fail. So the design does not try to detect failure
afterwards: it checks what it can beforehand, always leaves the transcript on
the clipboard, and tells the truth about which of the two happened.

Everything here composes existing platform code — ``jarvis.platform.clipboard``,
``jarvis.cu.actuate.get_actuator``, ``jarvis.platform.probes`` — and adds no new
dependency. Nothing is imported at module scope that a headless host lacks.
