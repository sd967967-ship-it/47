"""Does this wording provider actually work — here, on this host, right now?

The provider cards answer "ready" as soon as a key STRING is stored. For the
wording pass that claim is weaker than anywhere else in the app, because the
pass is INVISIBLE when it fails: it delivers the raw transcript and says
nothing. An out-of-credits account, a model the local server never pulled, a
family whose answer arrives after the latency budget — all three look exactly
like a healthy provider on the card, and all three mean the user's dictation is
never tidied up. Measured on one real install, four of five cards that read
"ready" could not format a sentence.

So this module asks the provider itself, with the same client the real pass
uses, and returns the shared ``ProviderTestResult`` vocabulary so the card, the
tab dot and the CLI all speak one language.

**Why it lives in the dictation layer.** ``jarvis/brain/provider_test.py`` owns
the per-tier probes for every other card, and this one may not live there: no
module under ``jarvis/brain/`` may name the wording pass, because a call site
there would put a model call one import away from the spoken hot path (AP-11,
guarded by ``tests/unit/dictation/test_polish_boot_safety.py``). The status
vocabulary and the error classifier are imported FROM that module rather than
restated, so the two can never drift (BUG-008 class).

Every import here is deferred to call time — the probe must never appear on a
boot path (AP-26).
