"""The dictation lane's on-device final-pass recognizer, hosted out of process.

Why this exists (2026-09-02 forensics, 220 dictations over four days): every
one of them ran on a cloud Whisper although the settings named the local
engine, because a user-scope environment override had moved the VOICE lane to
the cloud — deliberately, to keep the CUDA DLL load and a second large model
out of the desktop process (the 15-30 s loader-lock freezes of BUG-189 and
the VRAM oversubscription of BUG-204). The cloud round-trip was the lag the
user felt, and the cloud model's near-empty answers on 25 s windows were the
"truncated window" repairs that doubled it.

The dictation lane does not need the voice lane's provider at all. It needs a
strong local model that never touches this process's loader lock or VRAM
budget on its own — which is exactly the shape the live-preview worker already
has (:mod:`jarvis.dictation.preview_worker`). This module reuses that worker
with a stronger checkpoint and beam search, and presents it as an ordinary
``transcribe_pcm`` provider so the existing cross-family chain
(:class:`jarvis.speech.stt_fallback.FallbackSTT`) can put it IN FRONT of the
configured cloud provider:

* the worker builds off the press path (``warm_up`` after boot) and, failing
  that, on the first press;
* a card without enough free memory, a host whose worker only comes up on
  the CPU, a missing local runtime or a wedged worker all raise a CROSSABLE
  failure, so the chain moves to the cloud for that call and comes back
  later — no press is ever lost to the local engine being unavailable;
* a call that outlives its ceiling leaves a response in the pipe; the next
  call kills the worker rather than reading someone else's answer (AP-24:
  a wedged native engine is recovered by replacing it, never by waiting).

Nothing here is Windows-specific: the worker is our own interpreter running
our own module, the free-memory probe reports "unknown" where there is no
NVIDIA tooling (and unknown ALLOWS the spawn, AP-22 shape), and a worker that
comes up on the CPU is declined because a beam-search turbo decode of a 25 s
window on a CPU is slower than the cloud it would replace.
