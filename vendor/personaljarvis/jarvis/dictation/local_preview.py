"""Local engine for the dictation LIVE PREVIEW — the words while you speak.

The preview and the transcript want opposite things. The transcript wants the
best model available and can afford a round-trip; the preview wants to be on
screen NOW and is thrown away on the next tick. Sending both to the same cloud
provider meant the throwaway half was spending the quota the keeping half
needed — measured at ~40 requests per minute of speech, ~85 % of it preview,
against a 20 RPM ceiling that Groq applies to its **paid plan too**. That is
what made a 137 s dictation come back with 367 characters.

Measured on the maintainer's box (RTX 5070 Ti, faster-whisper ``base``,
int8_float16):

    1 s tail ->  34 ms      4 s tail ->  63 ms      8 s tail -> 137 ms

against 400-1500 ms plus one rationed request for a cloud round-trip. So the
preview is not merely cheaper locally, it is an order of magnitude faster —
and it costs no quota at all, which is what lets the transcript have the whole
budget. That is the difference between "runs out after 40 seconds" and "as long
as you care to talk".

Why ``base`` and not the model the transcript uses: a preview is read at a
glance and replaced a second later, so a rare wrong ending costs nothing, while
a model that takes 800 ms turns the preview into a lagging distraction. The
FINAL text is never produced here — it always comes from the configured
provider, so the words that land in the user's document are the good ones.

Degrades honestly (CLAUDE.md §3): on a host without ``faster_whisper`` — a base
or headless install — this reports unavailable and the caller falls back to the
budgeted cloud preview. No GPU is required either; the engine picks CPU and the
caller simply sees a slower preview.

In the desktop app the engine is hosted OUT OF PROCESS
(``jarvis/dictation/preview_worker.py``): building it in-process loaded the
CUDA DLLs (~600 MB of cublas) while holding the Windows loader lock, freezing
the whole window for 15-30 s on the first dictation after a cold boot. The
worker runs this same class; the parent talks to it through a faster-whisper-
shaped proxy (``_WorkerModel``), so every timeout/failure/recovery path below
applies to both hostings. ``JARVIS_DICTATION_PREVIEW_IN_PROCESS=1`` is the
debug escape back to the in-process build.

#: rebuilt with the SAME settings and dropped again, every 7 s for the whole
#: dictation. A drop therefore now advances to the next engine in the attempt
#: list (``_load_model``) instead of rebuilding the one that just failed, and
