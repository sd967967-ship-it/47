"""Provider surface for the dictation polish pass — two adapters, six families.

The one branch in this module
-----------------------------
``PolishFamily.transport`` is either ``"openai_chat"`` or ``"gemini"``. That is
a WIRE FORMAT, not a vendor: five of the six families below speak the
OpenAI-compatible chat schema and one speaks Google's. Nothing anywhere
branches on ``family.id`` — the id exists so a user can pin a preference and so
a log line can name who answered (AP-21: gate on capability, never on a
provider name or model id).

Adding a family is therefore a row in :data:`POLISH_FAMILIES` and nothing else.

Why the chain is credential-derived
-----------------------------------
:func:`resolve_polish_chain` returns the families the user actually holds a key
for, one entry per family, primary first. A depleted or unreachable provider
crosses to a DIFFERENT family; it never falls back to a second model in the same
one, because a rate-limited account is rate-limited for all of its models
(AP-22). When the user holds no key anywhere the chain is EMPTY, the caller
reports ``unavailable`` and delivers the raw transcript — byte-identical to the
behaviour before this feature existed. That empty-chain path is the whole
open-source contract: the maintainer's key must never be the thing that makes
the default safe (AP-23).

Why an on-device recognizer changes the chain
---------------------------------------------
Credentials alone are not enough to decide this, and the gap is a privacy
regression rather than a missing feature. Dictation is the most sensitive text
this application handles, and somebody who chose the on-device recognizer chose
it so their words would never leave the machine — the repo's documented
privacy-hybrid posture. If the polish chain asked only "what keys are there",
that user would start uploading every dictated sentence the moment they held a
cloud key for anything else, on an update, with nothing on screen to say so.

So :func:`resolve_polish_chain` asks one more question first
(:func:`stt_runs_on_device`), and when the recognizer transcribes here it offers
ONLY families whose endpoint is on this machine. An explicit ``polish_provider``
pin to a cloud family still wins: that is a decision the user made deliberately,
and honouring it is the difference between a safe default and a policy.

Why a credential is read once per change, not once per dictation
----------------------------------------------------------------
``jarvis.core.config.get_secret`` is not a cheap call — it reads the local file
store, calls the OS keyring and, on a miss, scans ``.env``. On a Linux desktop
with a locked keyring or a slow D-Bus Secret Service it can block for seconds.
The polish pass would otherwise pay that up to seven times to decide the chain
and AGAIN for whichever family it dials, the second of those on the event loop.
:data:`_SECRET_MEMO` therefore keeps one resolved value per slot, tagged with
``jarvis.core.config.secret_revision`` so an in-app save or delete invalidates
its own entry, and :func:`polish_chain_fingerprint` lets the caller reuse a
whole resolved chain until something that decides it actually changes. A read
that FAILS is remembered too, but only for :data:`_SECRET_FAILURE_TTL_S` — long
enough that one dictation cannot pay a blocking keyring twice, short enough
that unlocking it is picked up without a restart.

Why an endpoint that was not there is remembered
------------------------------------------------
The same argument applies one layer out. A family whose endpoint is on this
machine is refused instantly when nothing is listening on the port — but a
refusal per dictation is still a slice of a budget the design measures in
milliseconds, and a chain that pins the local family in front of a cloud one
pays it on every single delivery, forever, without the circuit breaker ever
noticing (the pass succeeds). :func:`note_family_failure` therefore records a
local endpoint that did not answer, and :func:`family_recently_unreachable`
keeps the walk from dialling it again for :data:`_LOCAL_REFUSAL_TTL_S`. Only
on-device families: a cloud outage is answered by crossing to another family
and, if it persists, by the breaker.

Import weight
-------------
``httpx`` and ``google-genai`` are imported inside client construction, which
happens on the first dictation — never at import time, never at boot (AP-26).
``jarvis.core.config`` (Pydantic, heavy) is likewise imported lazily inside the
credential lookup.

    Returns the families this host can actually use, primary first, each from a
    DIFFERENT credential family. An empty tuple means there is nothing to try —
    the caller then reports ``unavailable`` and delivers the raw text, which is
    exactly today's behaviour and must stay byte-identical (AP-23).

    Two rules decide it, in this order.

    **1. An on-device recognizer keeps the pass on-device.** When
    :func:`stt_runs_on_device` says the configured recognizer transcribes here,
    only families whose endpoint is on this machine are offered. The ``auto``
    default NEVER crosses to a cloud family, however many keys the user holds
    for other things — because the user picked a local recognizer so their
    words would stay local, and a chain derived from credentials alone would
    have started uploading every dictated sentence on an update, silently.

    **2. Everything else is credential-derived.**
    ``[dictation].polish_provider`` is a user PIN, not a code branch: a
    recognised id moves to the front and the remaining keyed families follow it
    as cross-family fallbacks, so pinning a preference never costs the user
    their resilience. A pin to a CLOUD family also overrides rule 1 — an
    explicit choice is a decision, and once it is made the ordinary AP-22
    resilience applies to it. It only counts while it is USABLE, though: a pin
    whose key has gone is not an opt-in, so it degrades back to the on-device
    chain rather than becoming a licence to upload. An unrecognised pin is
    ignored in favour of the auto order rather than emptying the chain — a typo
    in a config file must not silently disable a feature the user asked for.

    A keyless on-device family never enters the auto CLOUD order, because a
    chain that dialled localhost on every dictation would spend part of the
    latency budget on a connection refusal for the large majority of installs
    that never ran a local model. It is reachable by a pin, and it is the whole
