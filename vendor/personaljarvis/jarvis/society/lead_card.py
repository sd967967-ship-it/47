"""The lead's team card: what Jarvis knows about its society, every turn.

Jarvis is the harness itself and the one lead of the agent society. Every
society agent gets a briefing per turn (``surface.build_briefing``) that
names its teammates; until 2026-09-03 the lead got nothing. Asked "which
agents do you have?", Jarvis answered from the retired sub-agent (mission
worker) system its prompt still described and never from the roster — with
a freshly created Gmail agent standing on the island.

The card closes that gap. It is a deterministic, byte-stable block rendered
from the roster snapshot and the capability catalog — no model call, no
database read on the hot path — that:

* the brain appends to its system prompt (``BrainManager._build_system_prompt``),
  so the typed front-page chat and every delegated voice turn see it;
* the realtime session condenses into a per-turn directive
  (``RealtimeVoiceSession._society_directive``) so the live model routes a
  named agent to its action function instead of "I do not know who that is";
* the turn planner reads as agent names (``plan_turn(agent_names=...)``).

It changes exactly when the roster changes: ``Roster`` refreshes its
snapshot on every write, so an agent created in the Agents section is on the
very next turn's card without a restart, a hook or a model call.
