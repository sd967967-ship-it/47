"""WebSocket /api/runs/live — forwards run-relevant bus events to the open
Run Inspector so the in-flight run grows in real time.

Thin read-only adapter: it subscribes to the same EventBus the recorder uses,
filters to the forensic event kinds, and pushes compact frames. The receive
loop treats any non-clean read error as terminal (break, never continue) — an
unclean client teardown raises RuntimeError, not WebSocketDisconnect, and a
continue would spin on a dead socket (AP-20).

Bus access
----------
The bus is resolved from ``app.state.bus`` via ``ws.scope["app"]``, matching
the pattern in ``jarvis/ui/web/wiki_ws.py``.  The ``subscribe_all`` callback
is **async** — matching the real ``EventBus`` signature (``Handler = Callable[[Event],
Awaitable[None]]``).

Unsubscribe
-----------
The ``finally`` block detaches the wildcard handler via
``EventBus.unsubscribe_all`` so ``_wildcard_subscribers`` does not grow a dead
reference per connect/disconnect — important for a long-lived tray process
where the Run Inspector view is opened and closed repeatedly.
