"""``ScreenContextService`` — one capture, on request, then gone.

This is the orchestration layer: it asks the classifier whether the user
actually asked to look, checks permissions, picks the surface, announces the
capture, grabs pixels exactly once, redacts them, and hands back a short-lived
handle. Every piece of platform knowledge lives below it in ``ports.py``, so
this module is fully unit-testable with fakes and needs no display.

**Single capture, by construction.** There is no capture loop, cached frame, or
"refresh". :meth:`ScreenContextService.capture` grabs once and returns; the
only way to get another capture is another explicit call. The only timer is a
destructive TTL callback for an unconsumed handle.

**Retention.** A finished :class:`~jarvis.screen_context.models.ScreenContext`
lives in a :class:`_Handle` in memory, keyed by an opaque id, and is removed on
the first :meth:`consume` or when its TTL expires, whichever comes first.
Nothing is written to disk. This is a deliberate departure from
``jarvis.vision.screenshot.ScreenshotSource``, which persists every frame to
``data/flight_recorder/blobs/`` — correct for Computer-Use replay, wrong for a
feature whose promise is that the picture does not stick around. That is also
why this module uses the stateless ``capture_region``-style grab through the
port rather than reusing ``ScreenshotSource``.
