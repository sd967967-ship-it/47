"""E2E test against the real `claude` CLI (Phase 8.3).

Plan reference: §6.3 acceptance criterion 2 — single-iteration run with
the real Sub-Jarvis on a trivial task. < 60s p95.

Skip conditions:
- `claude` not in PATH → skip (no CI without the CLI).
- No login (with `--bare`, only ANTHROPIC_API_KEY-based auth is allowed)
  → the test is terminated by the claude CLI itself with a non-zero exit, which
  shows up as a pipeline failure. We are *not* testing the host's auth
  configuration, but that the pipeline path is green given correct auth.
- Marked with `pytest.mark.e2e`, does NOT run in the normal pytest run
  (`pytest -m "not e2e"`).
