"""The local-model shortlist must name models that actually exist, today.

A curated list of model names is a maintenance liability: tags in the Ollama
library are retired, renamed and re-quantised, and a stale entry does not fail
loudly — it reaches a user as "Ollama does not know a model called 'qwen3.5:32b'"
at the moment they finally decided to download something. That is the worst
possible time to discover it, and it is invisible to every offline test, because
offline the shortlist is just a tuple of strings that parses fine.

This is the guard. It asks the public registry whether each curated id resolves,
and it is also what keeps the list CURRENT: a maintainer bumping the catalog to
a newer model generation finds out here whether the tags they wrote are real,
instead of shipping guesses.

Network-dependent by nature, so it is marked ``integration`` and self-skips when
the registry cannot be reached — an offline CI run or a developer on a train
must not go red over it. Run it explicitly with ``pytest -m integration``.
