"""Integration tests for the WebServer's WebSocket endpoint.

Verifies:
- The welcome frame arrives immediately after connect.
- An event fired via bus.publish() lands as an envelope at the client.
- A ping command gets a pong response.
- Invalid frames are not forwarded, but publish ErrorOccurred.
