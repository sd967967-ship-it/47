"""End-to-end test for Awareness Phase A3.

Goes through the full happy path without mocks: open a real SQLite-backed
``RecallStore``, persist three real episodes through ``record_episode``
(which fires the FTS5 trigger automatically), instantiate the real
``AwarenessRecallTool``, call ``execute`` with a real time-bounded query,
and assert on the rendered markdown output.

The point is to catch wiring drift — schema/trigger out of sync, sanitizer
swallowing valid queries, time arithmetic flipped sign, etc. — that unit
tests with mocked stores would miss.
