    Two small JSON files decide what the workspace picker shows on its front

    workspace writes both, and it happened for real — a run left seven pytest
    temp folders in the recents list, crowding out the one folder the developer
    had actually opened.

    This lives in the ROOT conftest on purpose. The same redirect existed one
    directory down, covering the suite that was known to open workspaces, and
    the leak came in through a different suite that also does. A guarantee that
    only holds for the tests somebody remembered is not a guarantee.

    The scratch-folder rule is stood down for the same reason it exists.
    ``recents`` refuses to remember anything under the system temp directory —
    and pytest hands out ``tmp_path`` from exactly there, so with the rule live
    every test that opens a workspace in a temporary folder would be recording
    nothing and asserting against an empty list. Redirecting the STORE is what
    protects the developer's data; the rule itself is verified against the real
