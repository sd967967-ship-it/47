"""The Agent MCP contract: what any client connecting to Jarvis may rely on.

This is the promise the surface makes to the outside world, so it is pinned
here rather than left to drift: the tool set and its shape, the safety
properties (no spawn vehicle, dangerous work marked), and one end-to-end run
proving a client can find the team, talk to it, give it work and read the
result without ever touching the REST layer.

Headless by construction — no GPU, no audio, no model, no network.
