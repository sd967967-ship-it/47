"""New ecosystem capabilities must be decided FOR or AGAINST the MCP surface.

The failure this prevents is drift, not a crash. Somebody adds
`POST /api/society/agents/{id}/vacation`, the app grows a button, and every MCP
client silently stays a version behind — nobody notices, because nothing breaks.
Six months later the surface is a partial mirror nobody trusts.

So the society's REST surface is enumerated here and every route must be
accounted for: either it has a tool, or it is listed as deliberately not
exposed WITH a reason. A new route fails this test until someone makes that
call. Answering "not exposed, because …" takes one line — the point is that the
decision is made, not that everything is exposed.
