"""Activity-aware + terminal-reconcile crash recovery.

Root cause of the "Mission failed although it worked, ~1h later, randomly"
report (live forensic 2026-05-31, missions 019e6fea / 019e7095): a SECOND
Jarvis instance (e.g. a `--headless` launch that never sets
JARVIS_PRIMARY_INSTANCE, so server.py defaults it to primary) runs
`startup_recover` against the shared `missions.db` and sweeps the FIRST
(live) instance's ACTIVELY RUNNING missions to FAILED('crash_recovery').
Mission 019e6fea was marked crash_recovery 39 s after its iter-1 WorkerSpawned,
then ran on to MissionApproved 11 min later — the header stayed poisoned at
FAILED.

The robust fix makes `startup_recover` activity-aware: a mission whose last
event is recent (< stale_after_ms) is assumed owned by a live orchestrator and
is SKIPPED, never swept. And a non-terminal mission whose event log already
carries a terminal event (e.g. MissionApproved) is RECONCILED to that real
state instead of being failed — which also repairs already-poisoned missions
on the next boot.
