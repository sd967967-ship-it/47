# WorkerKilled(injection_detected) AFTER delivering a clean 30 KB diff,
# because the safety scan ran over the raw stream.jsonl — which contains
# the OUTPUT of the worker's READ commands (rg / Get-Content). The worker
# had merely read its own repo: `rm -rf /` from the safety blacklist in
# jarvis.toml.example, `OPENAI_API_KEY=...` from a wizard docstring, and
# `fetch('/api/secret...')` from the frontend. Reading dangerous strings
# is not authoring them — only worker-authored text (assistant prose,
# commands it wants to run, tool_use inputs) may trigger the kill-path.
