"""Tests for the worker-prompt composer + the artifact-language directive.

Root cause (2026-06-22): nothing in the mission-dispatch chain ever told the
worker to produce English code artifacts. The mission prompt is mostly German
(the user speaks German, ``spawn_worker`` wraps it with German labels), so the
worker naturally wrote German identifiers/comments/docstrings — violating the
repo Output Language Policy ("every artifact an agent produces is English").

The fix injects ``ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE_DIRECTIVE`` at the single guaranteed
chokepoint (``orchestrator._run_iterations`` builds the ``worker_prompt`` for
every worker, every iteration, every decomposition path) via
``compose_worker_prompt``. These tests pin that composer's contract.
