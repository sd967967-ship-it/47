"""Mission time-budget contract (2026-06-10 user mandate).

User mandate: a sub-agent task should complete in ~5-15 minutes on
average and never run much past 20 — while keeping output quality (the
critic loop, preserve-partial-work and grading stay fully active). The
pre-budget reality: per-iteration worker cap 1200 s and mission deadline
4200 s allowed 3 x 20-minute iterations, so complex missions ran 38-49
minutes and users gave up (live missions 019eb27f / 019eb288).

Shape pinned here:
- iteration 0 (the main build) gets the large budget (12 min);
- correction iterations get the short budget (6 min) — they refine an
  existing workspace, they do not rebuild;
- no new correction iteration starts when the remaining task time cannot
  fit a correction + one critic call (the mission records that explicit reason
  instead of pretending all three critic attempts ran);
- MAX_CRITIC_LOOPS stays untouched (ADR-0009) — the time guard is an
  additional bound, not a loop-count change.
