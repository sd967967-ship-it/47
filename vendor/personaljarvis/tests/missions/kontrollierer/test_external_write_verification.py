"""Regression tests for out-of-worktree deliverable verification.

Root cause of mission_019e7abd (2026-05-30, live voice failure): the worker
wrote the requested HTML file to an absolute path OUTSIDE its git worktree
(`C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\M\\hello.html`, exactly as the task
demanded). `_capture_diff` is worktree-scoped, so the captured diff was empty;
the Critic's GROUND-TRUTH-RULE then deterministically failed the mission 3×
with `critic_loop_exhausted` even though the file existed and was correct.

`Kontrollierer._augment_diff_with_external_writes` closes the gap: it pairs the
worker's real Write/Edit tool calls (from the stream) with an on-disk existence
check and appends the verified file content to the diff the Critic reviews — so
a genuine external deliverable is no longer invisible. Hallucinated writes (no
tool call, or no file on disk) are still excluded, preserving the empty-diff
veto's anti-hallucination intent.

These tests use a real on-disk git worktree plus a sibling external directory
(outside the worktree) so the worktree-containment logic is exercised for real.
