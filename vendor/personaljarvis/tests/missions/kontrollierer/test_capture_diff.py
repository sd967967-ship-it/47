"""Regression tests for Kontrollierer._capture_diff.

BUG-LIVE-01 (2026-05-14): on a live voice mission the `_capture_diff`
helper returned an empty string even though the worker had written a
file into the per-mission worktree. Root cause was that the worker had
written to OpenClaw's installation default (`~/.openclaw/workspace/`)
rather than the worktree (BUG-ALT-02, fixed earlier the same day). With
the workspace-pin in place, `_capture_diff` must surface every
artefact the worker produces — both modified and freshly created
files — so the Critic can review work it really did, not work it
hallucinates from a blank input.

These tests exercise the helper against real on-disk git worktrees so
the assertions cover the actual behaviour of `git add -N`, `git diff
HEAD`, and `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` together.

#
# A worker built a complete `schokolade-99.html`, then `git add` + `git commit`-ed
# it (as coding agents habitually do). After a commit the file is TRACKED, so
# `git diff --cached HEAD` is empty and `git ls-files --others` no longer lists
# it — the deliverable fell out of the untracked-only capture and was lost when
# the worktree was pruned; the user received only a materialised `.md` summary.
# The fix records the worktree's base SHA at creation and diffs/enumerates
# against that base so committed files reappear. These tests exercise the real
# WorktreeManager.create -> commit -> capture/archive flow.
