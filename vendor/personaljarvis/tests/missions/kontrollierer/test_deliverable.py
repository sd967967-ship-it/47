"""Tests for build_deliverable_summary — the voice readback that names files.

Live regression 2026-05-26: after a CODE task succeeded, the user heard the
canned "Mission abgeschlossen." with no mention of WHERE the generated file
landed. Two real HTML deliverables existed today on disk but the user never
heard about either — they thought nothing was produced. This helper turns the
archived-file inventory into a TTS-safe sentence the Kontrollierer can use as
``MissionApproved.summary_de``.

The archive layout is laid down by ``Kontrollierer._archive_task_artifacts``:

    <mission_dir>/tasks/<task_id[:13]>/artifacts/files/<rel-path>
