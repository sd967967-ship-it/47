"""A fresh install must actually do something on a schedule.

Audit AU-02: all three cron seeds shipped ``enabled=False`` and the only
enabled ones were ManualTrigger, so the WorkflowScheduler polled an empty list
every 60 seconds forever. Jarvis had a scheduler and nothing to schedule.

Exactly one cron seed is now on — the Morning Briefing, because it is the only
one that needs nothing a fresh install does not have. The other two need a
configured Telegram bot (and an authenticated ``gws`` CLI), so enabling them
would just manufacture failing runs on somebody else's machine.
