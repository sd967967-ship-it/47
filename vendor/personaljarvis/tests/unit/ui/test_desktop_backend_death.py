"""The backend is not allowed to die quietly.

Everything the user touches — every route, every WebSocket frame, every voice
turn — is serialized through one asyncio loop on one thread. When that thread
ends, the pywebview window keeps running on its own thread, so the app is still
on screen while being unable to answer a single request. All the user gets is a
grey OFFLINE dot in the sidebar (live report 2026-08-09): no reason, no
traceback, and no way back short of killing the app by hand.

Two holes made that possible, and these tests pin both shut:

1. An exception escaping a thread goes to ``threading.excepthook``, which
   prints to ``sys.stderr`` — and ``pythonw.exe`` has none. The loudest
   failure in the app was also its most invisible one.
2. Nothing acted on the death. ``run_forever()`` returning is either a
   shutdown someone asked for or an accident, and the two were indistinguishable.
