"""The polish pass as it is reachable over REST: Restore parity and the dry run.

Two contracts live here.

**Restore must produce the same text the live delivery would have.** It
re-transcribes the kept audio, and until it ran the identical chain — resolve
the language, remove fillers, repair the punctuation our own segment boundaries
broke, polish — pressing "Restore" on a failed dictation gave the user a
different sentence than the one they would have got had the provider answered
the first time. That is not a small inconsistency: the whole promise of the
button is "give me back what I said".

**The dry run is the only way to see the pass at all.** It is invisible when it
works and silently falls back to the raw text when it does not, so "is it on,
who answers, and what does it cost me" has no other answer. It also has to be
safe on a host that holds no key for it, which is most hosts.

# dictation will really reach. That answer belongs to ``resolve_polish_chain``

# pins an on-device recognizer to on-device models — so the route serves it
# rather than letting the frontend re-derive an order it cannot see (AP-4).
