"""GET /api/voice/status reflects the live voice boot state.

WebSocket events are not persistent, so a browser tab that connects *after* the
voice pipeline finished warming up would never see the one-shot
``VoiceBootStatus(ready=True)`` event. This REST endpoint lets a late-connecting
frontend read the current state on mount. The server subscribes to
``VoiceBootStatus`` on the bus and stores ``self._voice_ready`` on the server
instance (default ``False`` at startup) — deliberately not on ``app.state``,
whose ASGI lifecycle could outrace the bus subscriber on shutdown; the endpoint
returns that stored value.
