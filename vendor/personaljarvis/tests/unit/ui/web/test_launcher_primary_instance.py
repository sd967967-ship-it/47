"""Headless launcher must claim primary-instance status via the lock.

Root cause of the 94 `crash_recovery` false-negatives (live forensic
2026-05-31, missions 019e6fea / 019e7095): a headless Jarvis run NEVER set
``JARVIS_PRIMARY_INSTANCE``, so ``server.py:_init_mission_stack`` defaulted it
to ``"1"`` (primary) and the headless boot ran ``startup_recover`` against the
shared ``missions.db`` — sweeping the DESKTOP instance's actively-running
missions to ``FAILED('crash_recovery')``.

The fix makes headless decide primary status the same way the desktop path
does: whoever holds the single-instance lock is primary and may run the
sweep. A headless run that is the SOLE instance (the €5-VPS case) holds the
lock and stays primary; a parallel/secondary headless run (lock already held
by the desktop app or another run) marks itself NON-primary and must not
sweep — but still boots (headless is meant to coexist with a primary for
tests / parallel dev / smoke probes).
