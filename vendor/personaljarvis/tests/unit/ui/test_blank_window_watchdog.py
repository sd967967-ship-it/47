"""A window that shows nothing must heal itself, or say why it cannot.

The page's own watchdog (``frontend/index.html``) covers the case where a page
loaded and then the app above it died. This one covers the case underneath: a
window in which NO page ever arrived, where there is no script left to notice
anything. The maintainer hit it repeatedly on 2026-08-18…20 — a titled window
filled with the theme's ground colour and nothing else.

Three ways in, all reproduced in the logs of a single day:

* the single asyncio loop froze inside a native call (``Pa_CloseStream``,
  188.3 s measured) — the socket still accepted, nothing was answered, and the
  navigation received no bytes and no error;
* the backend thread died after the port was already up (a lost ``click``
  dependency mid-boot, 13:45);
* the web view never navigated at all.

The first is recoverable and must heal without the user doing anything; the
second never heals and must be said out loud; the third is worth one reload
before it is said. These tests pin all three, plus the loops that must NOT
happen (an explanation re-rendered every second, a reload storm).
