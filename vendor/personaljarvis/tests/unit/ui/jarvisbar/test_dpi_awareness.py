"""The JarvisBar makes its Tk window per-monitor DPI aware BEFORE creating it.

Regression (HiDPI "drag-teleport"): the bar's Tk root used to be created without
``ensure_dpi_awareness()`` — the orb sets it (ui/orb/overlay.py), the bar did
not. On a scaled display (e.g. 150%) the window's geometry coordinate space and
the pointer-event space then drift apart, so dragging the bar makes it run AWAY
from the cursor toward the bottom-right and become uncontrollable. The fix
mirrors the orb: assert DPI awareness in ``start()`` BEFORE ``tk.Tk()``.
