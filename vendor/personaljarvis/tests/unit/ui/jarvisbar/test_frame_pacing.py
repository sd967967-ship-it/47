"""Frame-pacing regression tests (stutter fix, 2026-07-10).

A 41s GIF capture of the bar frame-diffed to only ~5 visual updates/second on
average, in a burst-then-freeze pattern. Measured root causes (see the
constants' docstrings in ``overlay.py``):

1. Every branch ``renderer.render()`` can reach while the coarse mode is
   "idle" is time-independent (empty resting pill / hovered idle pill's
   static mic glyph / muted idle pill's static mic glyph — the equalizer
   bars and the close-X both require an active/listen/speak/think mode). So
   once its eased size has settled, re-rendering + re-blitting it every tick
   was pure waste — a real per-tick Windows DWM compositing cost paid for a
   byte-identical image. ``_schedule_frame`` now skips the render/PhotoImage/
   itemconfig work once idle has visibly settled (``_IDLE_SETTLE_TICKS``),
   regardless of hover/mute.
2. The re-arm delay is now adaptive (derived from actual tick cost via
   ``TARGET_FRAME_MS``/``MIN_FRAME_DELAY_MS``) instead of a blind constant, so
   an unusually slow render can't compound into an even longer visible gap.

These tests pin both contracts headless — a fake root/canvas/renderer, no
real Tk display, so they run on every OS including a headless CI box.
