"""A final-pass window that stops at a pause is re-read, not believed.

The failure this guards (live 2026-07-31): gpt-4o-class recognizers handed a
recording with a sustained mid-recording pause transcribe up to the pause and
silently drop everything after it. An 11.6 s dictation whose speaker breathed
after the first sentence came back as that sentence alone — fluent, punctuated,
and half of what was said — and it did so twice in a row, so this is a
behaviour, not a flake.

The detection is energy-only (AP-27's lesson applied to dictation): a window
whose transcript carries far fewer spoken tokens than its VOICED seconds must
have contained is missing speech. The repair re-reads the window split at its
pauses and keeps whichever reading carries more speech — never less.
