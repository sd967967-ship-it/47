"""The translate pass: speak one language, have the text arrive in another.

The feature reuses the polish pass's whole machine — chain, breaker, ceiling,
fail-open contract — and changes exactly three things: the prompt, the guard
set, and the status. Each of those three has a way of half-landing that no
other test in this directory would notice, and this file pins all of them:

* **The guard set must be the translate one.** ``drift_reason`` rejects a
  translation on ``language_flip`` by design — it exists to stop the polish pass
  translating — so wiring the wrong guard would reject 100 % of correct answers
  while looking like a working feature with a mysteriously high rejection rate.
  ``test_the_polish_guard_would_have_rejected_this_translation`` states that
  trap out loud rather than leaving it as folklore.
* **It must be ONE model call.** The pass sits between the key release and the
  words appearing; chaining polish-then-translate would silently double the
  wait for the users who turn it on.
* **The word floor must not apply.** Skipping the formatter on a four-word
  dictation is invisible; skipping the TRANSLATION on it delivers the wrong
  language into a live document, which reads as a broken feature rather than a
  tuned one.

The model is faked at ``build_polish_client`` — the same seam
``test_polish_chain`` uses — so the prompt that would really have gone over the
wire is what these tests read.
