"""A dictation warm-up that is still BUILDING its local engine must be waited
for, not replaced.

Live forensic 2026-08-24 (local models, first dictation after a restart): the
join gave up after 20 s with "warm-up did not finish; replacing the provider
instance", built a second instance, and that one restarted the same cold
whisper-large-v3 load from zero. Replacing an instance never shortens a load —
it repeats it. The user waited through both and the dictation still came back
with zero characters.

The rule pinned here: patience is granted only on evidence. A provider that
reports ``is_loading`` gets the long ceiling while it says so; a provider that
does not report it (every cloud one) keeps the short join it always had; and a
build that ENDS without the warm-up finishing falls back to the short join,
because a hang in the priming inference is a real wedge (AP-24).
