"""A trained custom_onnx wake model is calibrated differently from the pretrained
openWakeWord models, so it needs its own threshold band.

Live forensic 2026-07-01: a user-trained neural model fires on normal-volume
speech at ~0.9 and on breath/other words well below, while the pretrained OWW
models fire at ~0.15-0.23. Feeding a custom model the low 0.06-0.30 sensitivity
band false-fires; feeding it the amplify-only wake AGC lifts quiet BREATH to full
scale and false-fires at ~1.0. This pins the calibrated custom-model threshold
band (the AGC-off wiring lives in the pipeline OWW construction). Pure Python, so
it is identical on Windows, Linux and macOS.

# (engine Auto) in Settings, but jarvis.toml still carried
# custom_model_path=hey_nico.onnx from the earlier trained phrase — and the
# resolver's "any custom path wins" rule kept the NICO model as the detector,
# so the new phrase was deaf ("only Hey Nico still works"). Rule now:
# a custom model is auto-adopted only when it BELONGS to the configured
# phrase (model filename tokens, sound-folded); an explicit
# engine="custom_onnx" still forces it (user's own naming is their choice).
