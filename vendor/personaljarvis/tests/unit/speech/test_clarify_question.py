"""Clarifying-question ("Zwischenfrage") for an abandoned incomplete utterance.  # i18n-allow: German gloss of the feature name

Root cause (user report 2026-06-08, "Jarvis hört für immer zu"): when the user  # i18n-allow: quotes the actual German forensic user-report phrase
trails off on an open-ended fragment ("…erinnere mich daran, dass" + silence),
the ``ContinuationBuffer`` holds it with NO active timeout — it only drops the
stale fragment lazily on the *next* ``process()`` call. So a user who stops
talking is left in silence indefinitely: no answer, no question, mic open. This
violates AD-OE6 ("zero silent drops") for the incomplete-hold path.

This supersedes the 2026-05-26 *silent-discard* mandate (encoded in
``test_pipeline_completion.py``): the user now explicitly wants a clarifying
question instead of silence. The patience window is preserved — the question
only fires AFTER the grace window expires with no continuation, so a genuine
thinking-pause-then-continue is never interrupted.

Tested via the same ``SpeechPipeline.__new__`` stubbing pattern as
``test_pipeline_completion`` — the new clarify helpers
(``_arm_clarify_question`` / ``_cancel_clarify_question`` /
``_clarify_question_fire``) are driven directly against a real
``ContinuationBuffer``.
