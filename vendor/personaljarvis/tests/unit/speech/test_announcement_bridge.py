"""Unit tests for the TTS announcement bridge (Phase 5 CL-13).

The ``AnnouncementRequested`` event is emitted by the RouterBrain / tools
when the user should be given a concrete interim announcement without going
through the brain path. The ``SpeechPipeline`` subscribes to it and plays the
announcement via ``synthesize()`` + ``player.play_chunks()`` — the identical
path as normal answers.

Regression background (2026-04-23): the earlier tests here ran against
a ``FakeTTS`` with a ``speak()`` method. The real ``GeminiFlashTTS``
only exposes ``synthesize()`` though, and the old ``_on_announcement``
called ``self._tts.speak(...)`` — a silent ``AttributeError`` that made
announcements inaudible for months. The tests were green because the
fake and the implementation confirmed each other. Now it is tested
against the real ``synthesize()`` API.
