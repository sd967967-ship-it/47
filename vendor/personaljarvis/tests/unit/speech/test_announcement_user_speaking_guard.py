"""Async announcements must not barge a user who is holding the floor.

Structural backstop for AD-OE5 ("speak ONLY at the next turn-boundary, never
interrupt mid-utterance"). Every asynchronous TTS surface funnels through
``_on_announcement``: the Pre-Thinking-Ack, mission-completion readbacks, the
Computer-Use failure readback, workflow completions. None of them checked the
turn-state before playing, so any of them could speak straight over a user who
was still talking (``_turn_state == USER_SPEAKING``).

Contract pinned here:
  * A ``priority != "interrupt"`` PREAMBLE that arrives while the user holds the
    floor is dropped — it is ephemeral ("I'm about to think about this") and
    stale by the time the user finishes.
  * A COMPLETION/readback that arrives while the user holds the floor is
    deferred and flushed at the next turn-boundary (AD-OE6 zero-silent-drop) —
    the user still needs that answer.
  * A ``priority == "interrupt"`` announcement still punches through (the
    deliberate barge — e.g. a MissionFailed terminal readback).
  * Nothing changes when the user is NOT speaking (idle/processing).
