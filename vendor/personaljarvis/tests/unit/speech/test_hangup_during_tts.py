"""Pin the hang-up-during-TTS abort contract of the streaming voice path.

Live bug 2026-06-01 ("Jarvis shows SPEAKING the whole time even though it is
not speaking"): a vision question ("Was siehst du hier?") runs a Gemini
tool-use loop. The brain keeps streaming, so ``_merged_chunks`` never receives
its end-sentinel and ``play_task`` in ``_brain_streaming`` never completes.
When the user then hits "auflegen" (the hard kill-switch), ``_player.stop()``
alone is not enough: the ``await asyncio.wait({play_task, barge_task})`` is not
watching the hangup event, so it blocks forever. ``_handle_utterance`` never
returns, ``_active_session`` never reaches its ``IDLE`` finally, and the
supervisor — and therefore the UI voice-state — stays wedged on SPEAKING. The
log evidence shows the user pressing hangup repeatedly with no effect.

Fix: ``_brain_streaming`` waits on the hangup event too and aborts the turn the
instant the user hangs up, exactly like a barge-in, so the session loop can
unwind to its IDLE finally.

The fakes record causality, not wall-clock timing, so the assertions are
deterministic without any real audio device or network.
