"""Guards for the on-disk readiness probe behind the local speech providers.

The regression these pin: a local provider card that reported "ready" on an
install where the engine was never installed and the model never downloaded
(the defect that removed the local Whisper card on 2026-07-03). Every test here
asserts the FAIL-CLOSED direction — an unproven readiness must read as not
ready, because the alternative is a provider the user activates and that then
cannot transcribe a word.
