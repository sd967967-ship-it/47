"""``_speak`` must never hang on a stalled audio device / TTS stream.

Live incident (2026-06-01): a flaky output device made PortAudio's blocking
``stream.write`` (and once the TTS chunk generator) wedge ``play_chunks``
forever. ``_speak`` had no timeout around playback, so it never returned. That
froze ``_handle_utterance`` → ``_active_session``, so the ``_state_loop``
``finally`` that resets ``self._state`` to ``IDLE`` (the wake-loop's re-arm
gate) never ran — and "Hey Jarvis" went permanently deaf until a restart.

These tests pin the contract: regardless of which part of playback stalls,
``_speak`` returns within the hard ceiling and aborts the player (AD-OE6 —
recover, never silently hang).
