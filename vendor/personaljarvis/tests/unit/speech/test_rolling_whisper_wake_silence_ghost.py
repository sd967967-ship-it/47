"""Silence-hallucination gate: a bias-primed wake must NOT fire on silence.

Root-cause forensic (data/jarvis_desktop.log, 2026-07-02): the ``stt_match``
wake path primes its local Whisper with ``initial_prompt=<phrase>`` to lift
recall of a proper-noun wake word. The side effect is that on a near-silent /
steady-noise window the primed decoder HALLUCINATES the phrase verbatim and
Jarvis activates although nobody spoke ("fires out of complete silence"):

    rolling-whisper: rms=0.0036 text='Hey Fable, diese Eigen entde...'
    rolling-whisper: rms=0.0067 text='Hey Fable'
    echo-confirm: unbiased pass failed () — accepting the wake

The strict phrase matcher cannot reject these (the text IS the phrase), and the
bias-echo confirm has two holes these tests pin shut:

* Hole A — a hallucination that carries extra invented words skips the
  exact-phrase echo confirm entirely and fires.
* Hole B — when the confirm's second STT pass errors, the gate fails OPEN and
  fires.

The physical discriminator is energy: a genuine spoken wake carries a real
speech burst whose window rms clears a small speech floor, while a
silence-hallucination sits at the noise floor. The observed ghost cluster tops
out at rms 0.0043; the quiet-mic recall contract
(``test_rolling_whisper_wake_quiet_mic``) pins a genuine quiet wake at rms
~0.009 — so the gate cleanly separates the two.
