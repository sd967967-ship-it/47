"""Steady-state wedge accounting: slow calls must not tear the model down.

Live forensic 2026-07-02 (data/jarvis_desktop.log 08:21-08:26): ONE
transcription slower than the 8 s poll cap started a self-perpetuating deaf
cycle. Old accounting: the timeout counted as failure #1, the very next poll
hit ``TranscribeBusy`` (the SAME abandoned call still holding the model lock)
and counted as failure #2 -> ``recover()`` dropped a healthy model -> the lazy
cold rebuild ran INSIDE the next poll's 8 s timeout, re-wedged under load, and
the cycle repeated for minutes while the wake was deaf.

New contract (tested here):
- A ``TranscribeBusy`` poll is NOT an independent failure — a slow-but-alive
  call that eventually returns must never trigger ``recover()``.
- A busy streak longer than ``busy_hang_recover_s`` IS a true hang (BUG-036,
  un-cancellable native call) and must recover.
- After any mid-session ``recover()`` the poll loop re-warms the rebuilt model
  OFF the transcribe timeout (``warm_up``), so polling resumes against a hot
  model instead of racing a cold load against the 8 s cap.
