"""Regression guard: ``SpeechPipeline.__init__`` must never break voice silently.

The 2026-05-28 "Hey Jarvis dead" incident: a ``self._bus.subscribe(EVENT, ...)``
line in ``__init__`` referenced an event name that was not imported
(a ``NameError`` on an unimported event class). Constructing the pipeline
therefore raised, the desktop bootstrap swallowed it into a warning, and
voice died silently.

Constructing the pipeline with a REAL ``EventBus`` runs the whole subscribe
block. Any undefined / unimported event name in ``__init__`` now fails THIS test
(NameError surfaces here) instead of silently killing voice at boot — the bug
can no longer reach committed code unnoticed.
