"""The voice-hangup chokepoint must also cancel an in-flight CHAT turn.

Live bug 2026-06-19: the jarvis-bar X (``request_hangup`` → ``_trigger_voice_hangup``)
set the voice ``_hangup_event`` and cancelled active Computer-Use, but a chat
turn dispatched through ``desktop_app._on_user_message`` runs on a separate path
that ignored the X — so the brain kept thinking through ~27 X presses. The fix
wires ``_trigger_voice_hangup`` to ``runtime_refs.cancel_active_chat_turn`` so the
single hangup chokepoint stops a chat turn too.
