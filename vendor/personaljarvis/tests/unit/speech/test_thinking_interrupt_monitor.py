# Live bug 2026-07-01 ("Was steht alles in meinen E-Mails drin?"): while the
# brain was mid-think (6 Gmail messages already fetched) the user muted via the
# orb double-click. The thinking-interrupt monitor is a SECOND live mic that
# ignored the mute, "heard" audio, and aborted the fully-worked turn — empty
# answer, empty transcript. The muted wake loop could never capture a
# recombination utterance, so the turn died silently. Mute is an input-only
# contract (see _activation_allowed / _speak): the monitor must honour it too.

# cancellation — so the interrupt branch's ``await task`` after ``task.cancel()``
# blocked forever. ``_handle_utterance`` never returned, ``_active_session`` was
