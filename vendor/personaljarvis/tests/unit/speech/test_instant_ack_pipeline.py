"""Instant acknowledgment on the classic speech pipeline (2026-08-17).

The contract (jarvis/voice/instant_ack.py): a heavy turn gets its first sign
of life at dispatch time from the deterministic turn plan -- research, screen
and mission work immediately, actions and personal lookups after a short
grace and only if the turn is still processing. Actions get a request-specific
line from the flash composer or nothing. The router's grounded ack that
follows within seconds is dropped (no double-tap); the instant ack itself is
exempt from the anti-loop cap because it is one line per user utterance.
