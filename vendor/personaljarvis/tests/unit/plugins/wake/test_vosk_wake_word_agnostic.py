"""The wake verify must never depend on the free decoder SPELLING the wake word.

AP-27 in the Vosk path. Forensic (2026-07-13, 159 real captured "Hey Ruben"
calls from data/wake_debug, replayed through the production two-stage detector):

  * The free (unconstrained) decoder spelled the phrase in only 28 % of genuine
    calls. The rest came out as sound-alike garbage — "herum", "erhoben",
    "hey room", "hey oben", "hey ruhm", "heroes".
  * Rejecting on that garbage threw away 38 % of ALL real wakes; end-to-end
    recall sat at 32 % (the user had to repeat the wake word four or five
    times), while false accepts were 0/400 — the gate was far past the point of
    diminishing precision.
  * No spelling threshold can fix it: the free transcript "herr oben" was
    produced BOTH by a genuine call and by background chatter. Spelling is not
    a discriminator for an out-of-vocabulary proper noun, and every wake word is
    out-of-vocabulary for some installed language model.

The discriminator that DOES hold is the SHAPE of what the free ear heard at the
candidate position, which never asks how the wake word is written:

  * a wake call is short and stands alone     (measured: 0.72 s, 2 words)
  * room speech is a longer stream of words   (measured: 1.29 s, 5 words)

Both bounds derive from the configured phrase, so they hold for ANY phrase in
ANY supported language — the product requirement these tests exist to pin.
