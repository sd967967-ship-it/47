"""STRICT mode separation for the realtime surface fallback voice (2026-07-17).

Realtime and Pipeline are independent modes (maintainer mandate 2026-07-17):
each must work with only its own API keys, and neither may fall back onto the
other's providers or credentials — not even as a last resort. Live incident
2026-07-17 10:04: a gemini-live session (voice Fenrir) aborted a readback and
the re-render spoke as "Charon @ openrouter" because the pipeline `[tts]`
primary was openrouter-tts.

Forward guard: the emergency re-render resolves ONLY a same-family TTS keyed
through the realtime credential slots; no candidate → ``None`` (text-only).
Reverse guard: pipeline TTS credential resolution must never see a
realtime-scoped key slot.
