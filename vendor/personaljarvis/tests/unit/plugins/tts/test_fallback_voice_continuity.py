"""Voice-profile continuity across TTS takeovers (2026-07-17).

Bug: "the voice suddenly changes mid-conversation, masculine to feminine".
Every takeover path — the ``FallbackTTS`` wrapper, the plugins' internal
key-aware cross-family fallback — picked the taking-over family's arbitrary
default/config voice with no regard for the voice that was just speaking.
Live example (maintainer log 2026-07-11..16): primary OpenRouter spoke the
masculine model default (config voice "eve" is a Grok name, silently
replaced), then a 402/keyless failure crossed to Grok which spoke the
feminine "eve" — an audible mid-conversation gender flip.

Fix: curated gender tags in ``curated_catalog`` + ``continuity_voice``; the
factory pins the fallback family's profile-matching voice on ``FallbackTTS``,
and ``resolve_keyed_fallback`` accepts the failing provider's active voice as
``reference_voice``. Unknown profiles keep today's behavior (fail-safe).
