"""Shared CLI-brain prompt context extraction.

Regression guard for the live bug 2026-06-21: an English voice request was
answered in German (and spoken with an English TTS voice). Root cause — the
subscription-CLI brains (antigravity/agy, codex) rebuild their own flattened
prompt and dropped the authoritative reply-language directive that the
BrainManager appends LAST to the system prompt. The model then never learned
which language to answer in and anchored to the German persona ("Schef ...").
``extract_reply_language_directive`` re-surfaces that trailing directive so the
single authoritative output-language decision still reaches the CLI model.
