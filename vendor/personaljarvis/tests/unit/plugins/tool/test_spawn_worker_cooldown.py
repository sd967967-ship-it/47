"""Tests for the per-tool spawn cooldown.

Live regression 2026-05-27 (mission_019e6983-{82e7,a83b,b0be}): ONE user
voice request ("Subagent für HTML-Slideshow") produced THREE mission cards  # i18n-allow: verbatim forensic quote of the live German voice utterance under test
in the Outputs UI within 10 seconds. Root cause: the user's long utterance
was VAD-fragmented across multiple turns, and each turn that landed in the
brain either re-matched a force-spawn phrase or the brain issued another
spawn_worker tool_call referencing the prior turn's utterance from
history. Result: triplicate sub-agent missions for one task.

Fix: cooldown inside the spawn tool. After a dispatched spawn, subsequent
``execute`` calls within ``_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`` (default 30s) return a
short voice-friendly ACK and do NOT call ``manager.dispatch``.

These tests verify the SUPPRESS branch in isolation by pre-arming
``_last_spawn_at`` rather than going through the fire-and-forget
``_background_dispatch`` (which would require a full asyncio dance). The
arming itself is covered by ``test_first_spawn_arms_the_cooldown``.
