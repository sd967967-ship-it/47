"""The dedicated Vertex AI path: pinned route, project mode, ADC.

Sibling of ``test_google_genai.py``, which covers the INFERRED route for a key
stored in a Gemini slot. Everything here is about the case where the user picked
Vertex explicitly, and the three facts that makes true:

1. The route is PINNED — no probe, no AI Studio fallback. Without this a Google
   Cloud API key restricted to ``aiplatform.googleapis.com`` (ordinary ``AIza``
   shape, so indistinguishable from an AI Studio key) would be sent to the wrong
   host and fail every call with an auth error that names nothing useful.
2. The express key and the Cloud project are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE at the SDK
   boundary. ``genai.Client`` refuses both together, so exactly one shape may
   ever be assembled.
3. A configured project counts as a credential even with no key stored anywhere,
   because Application Default Credentials do the signing on that path.

No network and no SDK: the kwargs assembly is pure, and the client build is
driven through a stub module so these run on a base install.
