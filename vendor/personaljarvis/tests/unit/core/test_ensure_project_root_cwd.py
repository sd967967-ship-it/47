"""Regression guard for the CWD-drift bug class.

Many persistence paths (data/setup_state.json, the SQLite DBs, flight_recorder,
audit logs) are resolved relative to ``os.getcwd()`` under the historical
assumption that the desktop app always launches from the repo root. That
assumption was false — the autostart Scheduled Task sets a WorkingDirectory, but
a manual start / restart-app inherits the user home — so the same install
read/wrote a *different* ``data/`` dir per start method: the first-run guide
re-appeared on every restart and Chats/Sessions/Missions split across two
folders. ``ensure_project_root_cwd`` pins the CWD to the repo root so every
CWD-relative path is deterministic.
