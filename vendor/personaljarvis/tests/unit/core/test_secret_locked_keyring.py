"""In-app secret save must survive a viable-but-LOCKED OS keyring (headless Linux).

The pure-headless case (no D-Bus at all -> keyring resolves to ``fail.Keyring``)
already degrades to the 0600 file store. But on a Linux host where a Secret
Service IS reachable yet its collection is LOCKED (a common SSH / auto-login /
partial-D-Bus container session), ``keyring.get_keyring()`` returns a viable
SecretService backend, NOT ``fail.Keyring`` — so the old fallback that only
engaged for ``fail.Keyring`` was skipped, ``keyring.set_password`` raised
``KeyringLocked``, and ``set_secret`` returned False. The in-app POST
``/secrets/{key}`` route turns that into HTTP 500, so pasting a key in the UI
failed and nothing persisted. A locked/unusable OS keyring must degrade to the
file store at RUNTIME, keeping the "recoverable in-app" guarantee (CLAUDE.md §3).
