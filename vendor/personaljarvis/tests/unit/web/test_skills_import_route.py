"""AP-15 guard: a skill imported from a link lands as DRAFT, never live.

`POST /api/skills/import` downloads a third-party SKILL.md the user has not
reviewed. `parse_skill` treats a missing `state:` key as VALIDATED — which is
the active pool — so writing the download verbatim would auto-activate remote
content. Worse, the remote file can *declare itself* `state: active`.

Both paths are pinned here: whatever the remote says, the stored skill is a
draft, and promotion stays an explicit human act.
