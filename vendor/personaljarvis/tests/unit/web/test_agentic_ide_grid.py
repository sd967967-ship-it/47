"""Grid geometry of the Agentic-IDE workspace: where a split puts a pane.

The workspace is a split TREE (see ``layout_tree``): every split carves the
clicked pane's own rectangle and leaves every other pane alone, in both
directions and at any depth. The ``(column, slot)`` tuples these tests read
are the coarse hints `_renumber` projects from that tree — for the flat
columns-of-stacks shapes most of this file builds, the projection is exact,
which is why the assertions written against the old flat grid still hold.
