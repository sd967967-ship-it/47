"""Browsing folders by a typed path — the answer is the folder, not the route.

The path field reads like ``cd``, so what arrives here can be ``~/code`` or
``projects/..``. The listing itself already coped; the PATH handed back is what
becomes the workspace, so it must be the folder's own name — home spelled out,
``..`` folded away — never the text someone happened to type.
