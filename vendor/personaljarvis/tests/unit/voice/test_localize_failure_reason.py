"""A failure cause must reach the user in the TURN's language, composer or not.

Live 2026-08-20: the realtime path finally forwarded the cause instead of the
stock line — and a German turn then said "Das hat nicht geklappt: Gmail is not  # i18n-allow: quotes the mixed-language line this module repairs
connected — connect it in the Plugins view." Half the sentence in the wrong
language, because the contextual composer that was supposed to rephrase the
English tool string was dead twice over: its pinned model (gemini-3.1-flash)
is absent from the AI Studio catalog (404) and the key's credits were gone
(429). The composer is an enhancement; it must never be the only thing between
the user and a comprehensible sentence.

``localize_failure_reason`` is that floor: a deterministic regex table over OUR
OWN tools' error wording (AP-11 — no LLM), passing anything foreign through
unchanged, because a cause in the wrong language still beats no cause.
