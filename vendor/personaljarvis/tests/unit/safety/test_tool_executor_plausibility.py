"""Integration tests for the plausibility hook in ``ToolExecutor`` (Phase 4).

Not a full end-to-end voice test — just the three critical paths:

  1. Without ``plausibility_context_fn``: the workflow runs as before Phase 4.
  2. With a context provider + low confidence + an ``ask`` tool: approval is
     requested (even if the tier workflow would do so anyway).
  3. Whitelist downgrade: the plausibility check is skipped — otherwise
     the guard would break the whitelist logic.
