"""The transcript must record EVERY phrase Jarvis voices — not just the
normal brain reply.

User report (2026-06-15): the Transcription view only shows the conversational
turn (user utterance + brain reply). The "special" things Jarvis actually
speaks aloud — timeout/unavailable apologies, clarifying questions, skill /
mission announcements, the "still working" progress nudge, error readbacks —
go through a different speak path that never emits ``ResponseGenerated``, so
they leave NO trace in the session log even though they were spoken.

The fix: the pipeline publishes a ``SpeechSpoken`` event at every such speak
site, and the passive ``SessionRecorder`` persists it into ``voice_events`` so
the spoken phrase is documented in the transcript with its current turn and a
``spoken_kind`` tag (timeout / announcement / clarify / …).
