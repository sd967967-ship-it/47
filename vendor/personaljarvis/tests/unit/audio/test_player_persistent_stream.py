"""Unit tests for AudioPlayer's persistent OutputStream across play_chunks calls.

Background: 2026-05-16 TTS time-stretch diagnosis (5-agent deep-dive,
see docs/diagnostics/tts-stretch-2026-05-16.html). The streaming-TTS
pipeline calls ``play_chunks`` once per sentence. The original
implementation closed the ``sd.OutputStream`` in a ``finally`` at the
end of every ``play_chunks`` call, so every sentence boundary triggered
a fresh stream-open + WASAPI prebuffer + scipy ``resample_poly`` FIR
ringing — perceived as phonemes being elongated and duplicated
("Hallo" → "haaaaa lalala oooo").

The fix hoists the stream lifecycle to instance fields
(``_active_stream``, ``_active_source_rate``, ``_active_device_rate``)
so it survives between ``play_chunks`` invocations. The stream is only
torn down when:

  * the next call comes in with a different source sample rate, or
  * ``stop()`` is called (barge-in).

These tests pin that contract.
