"""The boot-ready cue: an audible "I'm listening now" after (cold) start.

After a reboot Jarvis needs ~25 s of warm-up before the mic opens. Saying
"Hey Jarvis" during that window does nothing, which the user reads as broken.
A short ascending tone played the moment warm-up finishes tells the user
exactly when Jarvis is ready — distinct from the wake chime so the two are
never confused.
