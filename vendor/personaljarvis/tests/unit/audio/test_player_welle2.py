"""Unit tests for Welle-2 AudioPlayer hardening (2026-05-16).

Background: After the Welle-1 persistent-stream fix landed, the user reported
new symptoms — audible crackling ("knistert") and gradual slowdown ("immer
langsamer") — that emerged from two latent issues that Welle-1 didn't address:

1. ``sd.OutputStream(latency="high")`` is a DEVICE-HINT, not a buffer-size
   specification. On modern USB headsets it resolves to ~10 ms — far too
   small to absorb the inter-sentence gaps in the streaming-TTS pipeline.
   Buffer drained → PortAudio inserted silence (crackling) and the device
   timeline drifted (perceived slowdown).
2. ``stream.write()`` returns ``True`` when a mid-write underrun occurred,
   but the return value was discarded. Every PortAudio underrun was
   invisible at log level — diagnose-blindness.
3. The samplerate-cascade in ``_open_output_stream`` re-ran on every fresh
   stream open. The pipeline calls ``player.stop()`` at end-of-turn (for
   barge-in support), so every turn paid the cascade cost. Log spam: 17
   "OutputStream @ 24000Hz failed" warnings per hour.

The Welle-2 fixes:
  - Explicit ``latency=0.2`` (200 ms) instead of the "high" hint
  - Capture ``stream.write()`` return value and log on True
  - ``_device_rate_cache`` mapping ``source_rate -> working device_rate`` so
    subsequent opens skip the cascade

These tests pin the contracts.
