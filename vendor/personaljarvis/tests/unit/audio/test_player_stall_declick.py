"""Feed-dry stall de-click in ``AudioPlayer.play_chunks``.

Live forensic 2026-07-21 08:40 (realtime session 43cb78d0, Gemini Live):
the provider paused audio delivery 1850 ms mid-sentence. The device buffer
drained, PortAudio underflowed, and the waveform was cut at speech
amplitude — audible as a choppy mid-sentence pause with a click/crackle at
both edges. The missing audio cannot be conjured locally; the fix smooths
the gap's edges instead: after ``FEED_STALL_FADE_S`` of dry feed the player
appends a short ramp from the last written sample to zero, and the first
resumed block is faded back in.

These tests drive ``play_chunks`` with a producer that stalls mid-stream
and assert on the exact PCM handed to the writer.
