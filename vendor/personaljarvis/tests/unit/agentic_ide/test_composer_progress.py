"""The composer says what it is doing while it does it.

Writing a brief is capped at about a second — a Flash rewrite of the spoken
sentence plus tree ``@files``, or the deterministic brief if that misses.
For that wait the terminal used to show nothing, which makes a working
composer and a wedged one look identical, and makes the wait feel longer
than it is.

So the beats are part of the contract now, and these guards pin the three
properties that make them worth printing rather than noise: they arrive in
order, every line names the pane it belongs to (a fleet composes at once, and
an unattributed line is worse than none), and none of them can ever cost the
prompt itself.
