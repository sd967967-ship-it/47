"""Choosing a writer and surviving one are different questions.

``resolve_writer`` answers the first: a pin that cannot be honoured degrades
openly rather than billing a provider the user did not choose. It says nothing
about the case that actually broke the feature — the chosen writer ACCEPTS the
job and dies inside it. Measured on the dev box 2026-08-02: the resolved writer
was a key whose prepayment credits were gone, so every composition for days
ended on the raw spoken sentence while a signed-in subscription sat unused.
That is the single-provider brick AP-22 forbids.
