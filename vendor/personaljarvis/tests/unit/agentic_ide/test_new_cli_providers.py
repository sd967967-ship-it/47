"""The CLI providers added alongside Claude Code and Codex.

Each of them exercises a different half of the registry contract, which is why
they are worth testing together rather than one file per product:

* **OpenCode** is a plain standalone CLI whose sessions live in a database, so
  it proves the discover-after-launch path works against something that is not
  a directory of files.
* **Kimi Code** ships as two generations under one binary name, so it proves the
  generation probe reaches the launch and history paths.
* **GLM** is not a CLI at all — it is the Claude Code binary pointed at another
  vendor — so it proves a launch profile inherits behaviour without duplicating
  it, and that the environment it depends on is never half-applied.
* **Grok Build** is a standalone native CLI that accepts a client UUID at
  launch, so it proves the mint-at-start resume path works for something that
  is not Claude Code.
* **DeepSeek Harness** keeps its interface OUT of the terminal — the pane boots
  a server and the chat is in the browser — so it proves an entry can be
  offered, detected and launched like every other while declining the one thing
  a terminal agent normally grants: being typed into.
