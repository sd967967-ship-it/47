"""Re-folding a whole workspace into columns of a given depth.

`test_pane_move.py` pins what ONE drop does; this pins what the app does on its
own initiative when a row has become too narrow to show the agents in it. The
two share an axis and nothing else: a move is a gesture the user made, a re-fold
is the grid answering a measurement.

Every failure mode here is silent on screen, which is why the arithmetic is
pinned rather than trusted. A fold that loses the reading order shuffles panes
the user knows by position; a fold that is not idempotent walks the workspace
one column further on every measurement; and a fold that touched a PTY would
resize a working agent's terminal for a layout change it has no part in.
