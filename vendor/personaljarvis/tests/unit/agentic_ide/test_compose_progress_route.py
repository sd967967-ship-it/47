"""The typed prompt bar hears the brief being written, beat by beat.

Composition is a no-thinking rewrite (target 1-5 s). The composer has always narrated
its stages, but for a typed send that narration went to stdout — the one place
the desktop user is guaranteed not to be looking — so the bar showed a silent
spinner and a working composer was indistinguishable from a wedged one. The
route now relays each beat onto the event bus as ``AgenticIdeComposeProgress``,
the same channel ``AgenticIdePromptSent`` already rides to every client.

Pinned here: the beats reach the bus with the fields a client renders from, a
dry run stays silent, and a missing bus costs the narration, never the brief.
