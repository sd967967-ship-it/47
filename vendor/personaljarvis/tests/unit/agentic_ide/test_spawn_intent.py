"""Guards for the spoken "open N more terminals" detector.

The feature this pins: asking out loud for five more Claude Code terminals
opens five panes in the workspace. The hazard it pins: that same sentence starts with
the word the router uses to recognise a BACKGROUND agent request, so without a
narrow grammar the utterance dispatches an invisible mission worker instead —
the 2026-07-25 defect class all over again, one layer up.

Two properties pull against each other here on purpose:

* a request that names TERMINALS belongs to the workspace, even though it also
  names the spawn vehicle ("spawne"), and
* a request that does NOT name terminals still reaches the background-agent
  path, because "spawne einen Agenten" means exactly that.

The discriminator is the terminal noun, and it is mandatory. Everything else
(verb, count, agent) is optional or defaulted, so the detector can only ever
claim a turn the user spelled out.
