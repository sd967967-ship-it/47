"""What holds — and what does not — once a workspace has far more than 12 panes.

The pane cap was 12 and is now 100 per workspace, while workspace count itself
is unrestricted. Twelve panes was small enough that several things could get
away with being O(n) in disguise or quietly bounded; a hundred is not. These
tests pin the parts that must scale and name the ones that are deliberately
bounded, so raising the pane cap again is a measurement rather than a hope.
