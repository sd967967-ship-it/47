"""The shape of a composed prompt, and the guardrails each task kind carries.

A note on how these tests are written. The obvious test — "no system prompt
contains the phrase 'double-check'" — cannot work here: the rule we want IS
"never write double-check into the prompt", so the phrase appears in the
instruction that forbids it. A word-blacklist cannot tell a prohibition from a
request. So the guardrails are asserted POSITIVELY: the prohibition must be
present and phrased as one. Whether the writer model then obeys is a live
question, not a unit-test question.
