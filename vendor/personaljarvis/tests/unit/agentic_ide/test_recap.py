"""Session recap: the one-line answer a pane header gives.

The recap is derived, never stored, so every test here pins a property of the
derivation: which signal wins when several are available, what a pane says when
it has nothing to report, and which rows of a coding CLI's TUI must never end up
in the header. Without the last one every busy pane in a grid reads "? for
shortcuts", which is the shape of a label that answers nothing.
