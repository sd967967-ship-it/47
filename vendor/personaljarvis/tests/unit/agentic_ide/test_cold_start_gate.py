"""Opening a workspace starts its agents in waves, not all at once.

The defect these pin down: every pane of a workspace mounts together, connects
together and therefore used to launch its coding CLI in the same instant. A
CLI's start is the expensive part of a pane — it loads its plugins and hooks
and then starts one process per configured MCP server, most of them through
``npx``, which resolves a package before it runs one. On a real install that is
eleven servers at roughly two and a half processes each, so eight panes meant
over two hundred process starts inside a second: every core pinned, the machine
unresponsive, and the app too starved to draw the panes it was starting.

The same work still happens — only its shape changes. What must hold:

* no more than :data:`COLD_START_LIMIT` agents are STARTING at any moment,
* a pane re-joining an agent that never stopped is never made to wait behind
  one that is booting (switching workspaces has to stay instant),
* a spawn that FAILS gives its slot back immediately rather than making the
  panes behind it wait out a settle window for nothing.
