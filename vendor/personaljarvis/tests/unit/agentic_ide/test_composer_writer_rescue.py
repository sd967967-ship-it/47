"""A writer that dies mid-call costs the WRITER, not the brief.

Resolving a writer and surviving one are different questions. The first has
guards in ``test_writer_resolution.py``; this file covers what actually broke
the feature on the dev box (2026-08-02): the resolved writer was a key whose
prepayment credits were gone, it answered 429 on every call, and the composer
handed the agent the raw spoken sentence for days while a signed-in
subscription sat unused. One dead credential must not brick the feature when
another provider is right there (AP-22).
