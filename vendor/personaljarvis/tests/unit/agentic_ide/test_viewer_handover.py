"""Which viewer a pane's output goes to when two of them overlap (BUG-113).

Viewers overlap constantly and by design: reloading the page, restarting a pane
or coming back to the section closes one socket and opens another for the SAME
pane in the same breath, and the agent behind it never stops. Which of the two
the server finishes first is a matter of milliseconds — so the rule cannot be
"the last one to speak wins", it has to be "only the viewer that still holds the
slot may release it".

Without that rule a departing viewer cleared a slot the arriving one had just
filled, and the result was the reported symptom: a full workspace of terminals
frozen on screen — sockets open, agents alive and typing into their transcripts,
screens that never moved again — while a freshly opened pane worked perfectly.
