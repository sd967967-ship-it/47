"""The model-written pane recap, and the promises it makes around the model.

The summary itself is a model's sentence, so what is testable here is
everything around it: that a pane always has a recap even when nothing can be
summarized, that a summary is asked for only when something has actually
happened, that the model's answer is read back forgivingly, and that no failure
path reaches the state read a pane header depends on.
