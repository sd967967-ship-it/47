"""The writer cache answers repeats; it must never answer a changed question.

Resolving a writer costs a config load plus a sign-in probe per candidate CLI,
and a fleet fan-out asks the identical question once per pane within the same
second. The cache exists for that repeat. Everything else here is about the
cases where remembering would be wrong: failures, spent budgets that differ,
a writer that just died in someone's hands, and a user who changed the setting.
