"""The bell: which terminals stopped while nobody was looking at them.

A workspace runs a dozen coding agents in postcard-sized panes, and none of them
announces that it is done — the spinner row simply stops being drawn. So the
feature is entirely about the TRANSITION, and every test here is about getting
that edge right rather than about the store around it:

* a pane that was busy and went quiet is reported ONCE,
* a pane that has been idle since it appeared is never reported at all,
* a pane nobody has instructed yet is never reported either, however much its
  starting CLI paints itself across the screen,
* the gap a TUI leaves between two steps does not produce a notification,
* and an entry never outlives the pane it points at — nor the workspace.

Each of those has an obvious wrong implementation that looks correct in a demo
and is unusable in a grid of twelve.
