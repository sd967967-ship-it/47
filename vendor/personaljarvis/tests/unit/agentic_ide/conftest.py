"""Shared safety net for the Agentic-IDE tests.

Opening a workspace touches two things that live OUTSIDE the repository, and a
test must reach neither of them. Both are redirected here for the whole package,
whether or not an individual test knows they exist — a per-test opt-in is a
guarantee that only holds until somebody writes the next test.

1. **The resume snapshot.** Every workspace change now records one. Left
   unredirected, a test would write into the developer's real data directory and
   leave the app offering to reopen a workspace that pytest invented in a
   temporary folder.
2. **The recent-folder history.** Same store, same failure, one page earlier in
   the wizard — and it happened: a run against the real store filled seven of
   the eight slots on the picker's front page with pytest folders and pushed the
   one folder the developer had actually opened to the bottom. ``recents``
   declines throwaway paths on its own now, but the redirect stays, because a
   test must not depend on a production filter to keep its hands off real data.
3. **The trust pre-seed.** Opening a workspace marks its folder as trusted in
   Claude Code's and Codex's own config files so no pane stops on a "do you
   trust this directory?" dialog. Against a real home that means every test run
   permanently added its throwaway folders to the developer's CLI configs. That
   is not hypothetical: it is why one such config had grown to 71 KB of dead
   entries, which the trust check then had to parse before every workspace open.
   The trust logic itself is covered where it belongs, in
   ``tests/unit/workspace/test_trust.py``, against a temporary home.
4. **The agent-account store.** Panes now record which subscription they run on,
   which means opening one reads (and resuming one could write) the developer's
   real account list. Same store, same failure class as 1 and 2.
5. **The workspace display preferences.** The remembered terminal text size is
   kept outside the repo too, so an unredirected test would resize the panes of
   whoever ran it.
6. **The project/chat library.** The newest of the five, and the one with the
   most to lose: it holds the user's projects and their chat history, so a test
   left pointing at it would both pollute the sidebar and give a delete test a
   real project to remove.
