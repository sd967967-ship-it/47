"""Explicit "use Computer-Use" requests must reach the screenshot harness.

Live repro (user, 2026-06-21): "Kannst du für mich bitte mit Computer-Use in  # i18n-allow
Spotify das Lied Perfect von Ed Sheeran abspielen?" was only ACKNOWLEDGED  # i18n-allow
("Ich schau gerade in Spotify nach dem Lied …") — the Computer-Use action never  # i18n-allow
dispatched or executed.

Root cause: the deterministic ``match_local_action`` gate had no pattern for an
EXPLICITLY-named Computer-Use request that lacks an open verb. The phrase
returned ``None``, fell through to the LLM talker, and the talker only emitted a
free-text acknowledgement (the gate's own comments already warn "never depend on
the LLM talker calling computer_use" — ``local_action_gate.py``). The strongest
deterministic CU signal of all — the user NAMING the harness — must route to the
harness without depending on the LLM.

These tests pin BOTH halves with no LLM:
  1. routing — ``match_local_action`` returns a COMPUTER_USE plan for the repro
     phrase and other explicit-CU phrasings (de + en);
  2. dispatch — driving the real gate through
     ``BrainManager._run_local_action_fast_path`` actually CALLS the tool
     executor with the screenshot harness and announces a completion (genuinely
     dispatched + executed, not merely acknowledged).

Precision guards keep how-to / explain / negated mentions OFF the harness.
