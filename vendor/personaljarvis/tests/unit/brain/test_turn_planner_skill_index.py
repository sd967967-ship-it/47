"""The planner becomes skill-aware without gaining IO or an import edge.

Realtime voice was completely skill-blind. ``turn_planner`` recognised only the
three literal trigger words in ``_SKILL_RE``, so an utterance naming an installed
skill produced no skill reason and never reached the orchestrator that could
run it. Meanwhile the live model in delegate mode sees exactly two function
declarations, neither of which is a skill.

Two properties matter here and they pull against each other:

* the planner must SEE installed skills, and
* it must keep its promise of no model call, no disk access, no network — which
  is why the index arrives as a frozen data snapshot through an optional
  parameter instead of being imported.
