"""Wall-clock deadline for the tool-use loop (delegated realtime turns).

Forensic origin (voice session 2026-07-14 09:29): a delegated "what is
in my wiki" turn ran ~14 sequential LLM rounds over 66 s — the iteration
budget (15 turns) was the only bound, and it carries no notion of time.
A voice user is gone long before round 14.

Contract under test:
  1. When the deadline is exceeded after a tool round, the loop runs
     exactly ONE final round WITHOUT tools, carrying a directive to
     answer from the gathered evidence — the user always hears a
     grounded answer, never silence and never more tool churn.
  2. Without a deadline (default) behavior is unchanged.
  3. A generous deadline never fires on a fast turn.
