"""Captured-screen turn: the tool surface is narrowed, never emptied.

Historically hard ``{}`` (docs/screen-context.md §3.1a, maintainer mandate
2026-08-02 "looking is not operating"), then widened once for a mandated WRITE
tool (code-review finding 2026-08-08).

2026-08-17 review: an emptied surface left a turn that arrives WITH an image but
still asks for an action describing a picture with no way to do the thing that
was asked. ``computer_use`` therefore stays in the surface; the look/operate
boundary is enforced per call by ``cu_gate.llm_computer_use_allowed``, which
reads the USER's utterance and so refuses a pure look request anyway (pinned in
``test_screen_turn_computer_use_boundary_still_holds`` below).

A turn whose utterance itself mixes a look with an action ("Schau mal hier. Mach
das Fenster zu.") never reaches this surface at all: ``intent`` now reads the
German separable verb and hands the turn to Computer-Use with no capture.
