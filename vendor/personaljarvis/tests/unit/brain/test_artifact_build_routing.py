"""Build-a-deliverable requests without an explicit delegation trigger stay inline.

History: the 2026-06-21 fix (voice session 19:13, "build me an HTML file ...")
made build-a-deliverable requests force-spawn a mission deterministically,
because a tool-incapable talker could not spawn via an LLM tool_call. The
maintainer mandate 2026-07-21 SUPERSEDES that implicit spawn: a background
agent starts ONLY on an explicit ask (``force_spawn_phrases``: "spawn",
"Subagent", "deep dive", the depth markers, …). A build command without
delegation wording is handled by the router LLM, which answers inline or
OFFERS a background agent (jarvis.brain.spawn_gate) — the user's confirming
yes unlocks exactly one spawn.

The artifact DISCRIMINATOR (``_research_wants_artifact``) stays intact — it
still powers the spawn-tool visibility gates — and an explicit trigger wrapped
around a build request still force-spawns.

Deterministic — no LLM, no real brain.
