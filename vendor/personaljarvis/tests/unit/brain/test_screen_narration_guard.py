"""Screen-narration guard (live failure 2026-06-14).

A small-talk / knowledge conversation (Marie Curie, Nobel Prizes) was followed
by the cut-off fragment ``"Kannst du mir sagen, was genau..."``. The router
brain answered by *describing the screen* — "Auf Ihrem Bildschirm ist zu sehen,
dass die Spracherkennung ... abgebrochen ist ..." — although no screenshot was
ever attached or captured (the live log shows ``vision_none=True`` and zero
screenshot-tool executions). The narration was a pure fabrication.

Two defences, mapping to the two requirements:

1. Deterministic tool-gate (``BrainManager._gate_screen_tool``): the on-demand
   ``screenshot`` tool is only offered when the utterance actually refers to the
   screen (or an image is already attached, or it is a pointer turn). A plain
   conversational / cut-off fragment can no longer reach for — and then narrate
   — the screen. Reuses ``should_attach_screenshot`` so the marker-bearing
   screen questions of 2026-05-31 keep the tool.

2. Prompt honesty (router ``SYSTEM_PROMPT`` SCREEN-CONTEXT block): with no image
   attached the brain has NOT seen the screen and must never describe it; a
   vague / cut-off utterance gets one short clarifying question.
