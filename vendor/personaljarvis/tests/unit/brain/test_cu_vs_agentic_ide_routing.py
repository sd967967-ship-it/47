"""Computer-Use-vs-Agentic-IDE routing (desktop verbs inside a pane order).

Live bug (voice session 2026-07-26 09:44, focused coding mode ON, twelve panes
open): the user asked, in German, for the pane called Bruno to do a deep dive
into why text cannot be pasted in the Agentic IDE. The verbatim transcript is
``LIVE_FAILURE`` below. Jarvis did not brief Bruno. It drove Computer-Use
instead, clicked into the workspace's own chat box and typed a prompt there —
the assistant operating its own UI by hand while a coding agent named in the
sentence sat idle.

Root cause (measured, not guessed): two deterministic gates claim this turn and
the older one runs first. ``BrainManager.think`` consults
``_run_local_action_fast_path`` before ``_run_agentic_ide_fast_path``, and the
desktop gate matches on the GUI verb "kopieren" — a word that appears here in
the *description of the problem*, never as an order to copy anything. A gate
that reads intent from single verbs cannot tell "copy this" from "copying is
broken", so the tie has to be broken by the stronger signal: the user named a
pane.

Since 2026-08-25 the desktop gate can also make that distinction itself. Its
TASK-or-QUESTION guard reads the clause
"wieso man ... nicht kopieren kann"  # i18n-allow: quoted transcript
as a question and stands down. The pane-precedence rule below stays exactly as
it was — it is the layer that must hold when the wording is a genuine order
that merely sounds like desktop work, and one gate being fixed is no reason to
remove the other.

This is the sibling of ``test_cu_vs_spawn_routing.py``. There a depth marker
("Deep Dive") wrongly beat an explicit screen request; here a screen verb
wrongly beats an explicitly addressed terminal. Same shape, opposite direction:
whichever gate holds the more specific evidence wins.

The second half is why the reordering alone would not be safe. Name resolution
is fuzzy on purpose (a call-sign arrives through speech recognition), and the
weakest evidence path in ``intent.detect_all`` — "the utterance names a pane and
contains a verb" — accepts a merely *similar* word. Measured against the
shipping name pool, "unten" resolves to "Hunter" and "dann" to "Dana"; against
the live session's pool "keine" resolved to "Kai"  # i18n-allow: quoted transcript tokens
(all four are everyday words of the spoken language, quoted as measurement
data), which is how the failing turn addressed a second pane nobody had
named. Letting the workspace outrank the
desktop gate on that evidence would hand ordinary desktop commands to a coding
agent. So a name that is only *approximately* right can no longer claim a turn
on its own.

Deterministic throughout: real gate, real detector, faked prompt composer.
