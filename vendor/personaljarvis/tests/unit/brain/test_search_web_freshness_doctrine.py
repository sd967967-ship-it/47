"""Regression guard: the router answers evergreen knowledge DIRECTLY and reserves
``search_web`` for genuinely fresh / volatile facts (or an explicit search
request) — the "Frische-Grenze" mandate.

Live forensic 2026-06-20: a plain knowledge question — "Kannst du mir sagen,
was ich alles beachten muss, wenn ich auswandern moechte?" — made the  # i18n-allow
router LLM fire ``search_web`` THREE
times (proven from sessions.db voice_events: 3x ``ActionProposed search_web``,
``jarvis_text`` empty) instead of just answering. The Run-Inspector labels a
``search_web`` call "Recherche"; the user read that as an unwanted
sub-agent / research spawn for a trivial question.

The deterministic force-spawn gate behaved correctly (it did NOT spawn — that
path is covered by ``test_routing.py``). The over-eager choice came from the
router prompt + the ``search_web`` tool description, which both told the model
to search for ANY "Wissensfrage / was ist X / erklaer mir X".

Mandate ("Frische-Grenze"): evergreen / general knowledge is answered from the
model's own knowledge; ``search_web`` fires only for fresh / volatile facts
(news, prices, weather, "aktuell / heute / neueste") or an explicit search
request.
