"""One set of coding CLIs, described by six layers — bound here so it stays one.

The registry, the account layer, the voice command schema, the spoken-alias
table, the session-resume adapters and the REST payload each answer "which
coding CLIs are there?" in their own words. Nothing forced them to agree, and
the drift is the quiet kind (BUG-008's class): every layer keeps working, one of
them just stops mentioning a provider, and the symptom is a feature that is
present everywhere except the one surface a user happens to reach it from.

It had already happened twice before these tests existed — a probe type union
listing a CLI the account layer did not, and a TypeScript union missing an auth
mode the backend had been sending for weeks.

Each test below states which two layers it binds and what a user loses when
they part company.
