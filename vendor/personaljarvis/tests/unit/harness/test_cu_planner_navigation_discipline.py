"""Planner discipline: a 'find X's posts/news on a site' goal must NAVIGATE,
not turn the goal's descriptive words into a literal site search.

Root cause (2026-06-15 20:54 live run, exit 5): the voice goal "open Chrome and
search for the news post from Elon Musk on X" made the plan-first planner emit a
5-step plan whose final step was *type 'news' and press Enter*. The planner had
lifted the descriptive word "news" straight out of the goal ("the **news** post
from Elon Musk") and treated it as a search query. After the agent had correctly
navigated toward Elon Musk's X profile -- where the goal was effectively
satisfied -- that spurious step drove it onto ``x.com/search?q=news``, the wrong
page. The completion judge correctly rejected that state, the model then wandered
through stray dialogs trying to recover, the done-reject budget was exhausted,
and the mission reported a false failure.

The decisive contrast: four minutes later the same target asked as "research
Elon Musk's profile, what was his latest post" produced a plan with NO literal
keyword-search step, landed on ``x.com/elonmusk``, and verified done on the first
try. The variable that flipped the outcome was the planner's spurious search
step.

The fix adds a NAVIGATION-vs-SEARCH discipline to the planner system prompt so a
content-retrieval goal is decomposed into navigating to the target page (and
stopping), never into typing one of the goal's descriptor words ('news',
'latest', 'post', ...) into the site search box. Legitimate searches (a goal
that names an explicit topic to search FOR) are untouched.

All tests drive ``_run_screenshot_loop`` directly with fakes -- no real
screenshots, no real UIA, no real model calls.
