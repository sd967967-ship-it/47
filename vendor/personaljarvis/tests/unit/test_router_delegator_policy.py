"""Policy tests for the router delegator prompt.

These tests make NO LLM calls — they only pin that the policy strings are
present in SYSTEM_PROMPT. Real classification-accuracy tests live in
test_tier_router.py (goldset with 50 utterances).

Update 2026-06-10 (user mandate): spawn_worker is reserved for GENUINELY
HEAVY tasks. Light AND medium requests (news/knowledge/research questions,
single reads, anything the router can finish inline with its own tools) are
handled by the router itself — thinking a little longer is fine; a
multi-minute worker mission for a single lookup is not. The
on-uncertainty default flipped accordingly: try it yourself first,
delegate only clear heavy chunks.
