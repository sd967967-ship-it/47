"""Load seed jobs — YAML files from ``conductor/seed/``.

Unlike Jarvis workflows (hardcoded Python factories), we maintain the
Conductor seeds as **YAML files**. That's the same job format users
type in themselves — we're our own test case for it.

Idempotency: each seed job's UUID lives in the YAML and is respected
across repeated calls.
