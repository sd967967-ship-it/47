"""Conductor — a better canvas for agentic workflows.

Conductor is a **standalone open-source tool** that originated in this
monorepo but is not tied to Jarvis:

- Standalone mode: ``python -m conductor serve`` starts its own
  FastAPI server on port 7777 with SQLite in ``~/.conductor/``.
- Embedded mode: Jarvis imports the package, mounts the router in
  its own FastAPI server, and shows a dashboard view.

It is deliberately not an n8n clone — no drag-and-drop nodes, no graph.
Instead:

- **Jobs are YAML** — git-friendly, copy-pasteable, diffable.
- **Timeline view** — all runs chronological instead of spatial.
- **Three job types**: shell, http, agent. That covers 95% of all
  scheduled-task + agentic-workflow use cases.
- **Built-in observability** — every run has live logs, duration,
  exit code, tokens, cost (if agent) — none of it needs to be
  activated separately.

Public API:
  ``ConductorStore``, ``Runner``, ``Scheduler``, ``Job``, ``Run``, and
  the three ``JobHandler`` implementations.
