"""Smoke test Phase 6 / Prompt 2: worker layer end-to-end against the real claude binary.

Verifies the T1+T2 API surface in a realistic mini run:

1. `claude` must be on PATH. If not: `[SKIP]` + exit 0 (NOT a failure).
2. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` as the basis for the worktree.
3. `WorktreeManager.create(mission_slug='smoke', task_id='p2')` creates a
   fresh branch + workspace directory.
4. `WindowsJobObject('smoke-p2')` as an async context manager — on non-Windows
   it's a no-op, the smoke still runs (worker spawns normally, no reaping).
5. `ClaudeDirectWorker.spawn(prompt, ..., max_turns=3)` with a cost cap (--max-turns
   is cost guardrail #1 per the research doc §B). The stream is drained until the
   `result` event. (The legacy worker class was removed in the
   Jarvis-Agent/UFO3 removal — `f9fa1c2f`; ClaudeDirectWorker is the
   production claude-CLI worker.)
6. Verify `(workspace / 'hello.txt').exists()` AND content == 'world'
   (with/without a trailing newline).
7. Verify via `psutil.pid_exists(pid)` that the worker subprocess terminated
   cleanly.
8. Cleanup: `WorktreeManager.remove(workspace, force=True)`.

Exit 0 on success OR on `[SKIP]`. Exit 1 only on real failures.
