"""Dead-config-switch gate.

A config field the user can set but that no code ever reads is worse than a
missing feature: the settings screen and ``jarvis.toml`` promise behaviour that
does not exist, and the user cannot tell the difference from the outside. A
whole ``[jarvis_agents]`` section shipped that way.

This gate enforces the invariant: **every field declared on a config model in
``jarvis/core/config.py`` is read by at least one line of shipped code.**

What counts as reading it, deliberately narrowly:

* an attribute access (``cfg.section.field``),
* a name or keyword argument (``field=``, ``field``),
* a string that is EXACTLY the field name (``getattr(cfg, "field")``,
  ``payload["field"]``).

Prose does not count. Field names are collected from the AST, so a comment or
docstring merely *mentioning* a switch never keeps it alive — that is the
difference between a switch being documented and a switch being wired. Tests do
not count either: a switch only a test knows about is dead in the product,
which is exactly the bug class this gate exists to catch. ``jarvis.toml`` does
not count, because writing a value is not reading it.

Static analysis only — it never imports the app, so it is cheap and
dependency-free. Run from a pre-push hook and in CI; also covered by
``tests/unit/core/test_config_switches_wired.py``.
