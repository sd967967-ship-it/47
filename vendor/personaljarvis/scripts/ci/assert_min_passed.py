"""Minimum-passed-count floor (Wave 0, sub-task 0.5).

A broken conftest or a mass-skip regression can make pytest exit 0 while almost
nothing actually ran. This gate parses the JUnit XML and asserts that the number
of PASSED tests is at least ``FLOOR``. A drop below the floor fails the build
even when pytest's own exit code is green.

Usage: ``python scripts/ci/assert_min_passed.py [--strict] report.xml``

FLOOR is seeded conservatively from the current green count on the branch. Bump
it FORWARD as the suite grows — NEVER down (lowering it defeats the purpose).
