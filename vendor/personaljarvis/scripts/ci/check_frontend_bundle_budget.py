"""Frontend startup-bundle budget guard — fail when the entry chunk gets fat again.

Why this exists (2026-07-26): ``MainView.tsx`` imported all 21 section views
statically, so EVERY section — plus the terminal emulator and the charting
library almost nobody opens on start — was linked into the single entry chunk.
It reached 2.83 MB, and a WebView must download, parse and execute all of it
before React paints its first pixel. The boot splash in ``index.html`` only
hid the wait; it did not shorten it.

This is the frontend twin of ``check_boot_budget.py``: that one guards the
Python startup path, this one guards the bytes the UI must chew through before
it is interactive. Both exist because the regression class is identical — a
feature "only adds a bit" until the app takes seconds to become usable.

What it measures: the size of the ES module entry chunk that ``dist/index.html``
actually references (never a guessed filename — ``dist/`` accumulates stale
hashed chunks from earlier builds), plus the stylesheet it loads. Lazy chunks
are deliberately NOT counted: they are the fix, and they load off the critical
path.

Budget: ``JARVIS_BUNDLE_BUDGET_ENTRY_KB`` (default 1350). Set from what the
first screen genuinely needs, re-measured 2026-08-20: the entry is ~1320 KB,
and roughly 300 KB of that is framer-motion, whose layout-projection engine the
mission deck uses in its FIRST frame — the orb travels from the standby stage
to the board on a shared ``layoutId``. That weight cannot be split off without
giving up the hand-off itself, so a 1200 KB line could only ever be red.

A gate that is permanently red reports nothing, which is how ~200 KB of genuine
accident survived in the startup path until this was re-measured: the wiki
graph library, the agentic-IDE API client and two shell hooks were all being
parsed before the first paint by screens that never touch them. Those are gone
(1528 -> ~1320 KB). The 30 KB of headroom above today's number is deliberately
tight: normal feature work belongs in a lazy chunk, and the next thing that
lands here should have to argue for itself.

Exit codes: 0 = within budget, 1 = budget exceeded, 78 = skipped (no build
present) so callers can treat "could not measure" as neutral rather than red.
