"""Fail-closed guard: requirements.in must mirror pyproject [project].dependencies.

This is the guard for the bug class that shipped a broken public installer:
``requirements.in`` (the source for the hash-pinned ``requirements.txt``
lockfile) drifted from ``pyproject.toml [project].dependencies``. It listed
extras-only, native packages (for example ``faster-whisper`` and desktop input
drivers) that pyproject deliberately keeps in the ``[local-voice]`` /
``[desktop]`` extras per the cloud-first doctrine (CLAUDE.md §3). The lockfile
compiler then baked the multi-GB, GPU-specific CUDA-13 wheel stack (``nvidia-*``) into the
committed lockfile, and the Windows/macOS installer forced every downloader
through it with ``pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt`` — which is
unresolvable on a plain-PyPI machine (``nvidia-cufile==1.15.1.6`` does not exist
on PyPI). "Works on my machine" is the defect (AP-23).

``requirements.in`` is the base runtime set ONLY. Every line in it must appear,
byte-for-byte on name + extras + version specifier + environment marker, in
``pyproject.toml [project].dependencies`` and vice-versa. Extras
(``[project.optional-dependencies]``) are intentionally NOT mirrored here — they
are installed separately and never enter the base lockfile.

Exit 0 when in lockstep; exit 1 with a diff otherwise.
