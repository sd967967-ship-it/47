"""Blocky bipeds modelled by script onto the contract's 23-bone rig.

Route B of the character pipeline (character-pipeline.md §8.2), for the styles
the CC0 adventurer pack has no body for: an office worker and a casual person
(``modern``), a big-headed chibi (``cartoon``) and an android (``scifi``).

Why boxes: the island renders through a pixel pass at ~240 px wide, so what
reads at that size is silhouette and colour, not topology. Every piece is one
axis-aligned box, rigidly weighted to exactly ONE bone — no skinning weights
to author, no joint that pinches, and 12 triangles a piece against a 4 500
budget. The rig and its nine clips come from the same CC0 donor the fantasy
bases use, so a new body walks, sits, sleeps and waves on day one.

Proportions are the rig's, not ours: a box spans the rest positions of the
bone it hangs on, so a knee meets a shin whatever the profile does with
widths. Only the head — a free-floating box on the ``head`` bone — changes
size between profiles, which is exactly what separates a person from a chibi.

Coordinates are Blender's: Z up, the figure faces −Y, +X is its left.
