"""Generate ``assets/icons/jarvis.icns`` — the macOS app-bundle icon.

macOS is the only platform that cannot read the ``.ico``/``.png`` pair the rest
of the project ships: ``CFBundleIconFile`` resolves to an ``.icns`` container,
and PyInstaller's ``BUNDLE`` copies exactly that file into
``Contents/Resources``. Without it the Dock, Finder, Spotlight, and the
Cmd-Tab switcher all fall back to the generic executable icon.

Run it from anywhere; it resolves the repository from this file's location:

    python packaging/macos/make_icns.py            # write the icns
    python packaging/macos/make_icns.py --check    # verify only, write nothing

Honest limitation, deliberately not hidden: the largest mascot master in the
repository is 256x256 (``assets/icons/jarvis-gigi-256.png``). Apple's icon set
goes to 1024x1024, so the 512 and 1024 members are upscaled with Lanczos
resampling and are correspondingly soft on a Retina display at large sizes.
Drop a 1024x1024 master next to the 256 one and rerun this script to fix that
for good — :data:`SOURCE_CANDIDATES` prefers the biggest available source.

Pillow's ICNS writer always emits the full ``ic07``/``ic08``/``ic09``/``ic10``/
``ic11``/``ic12``/``ic13``/``ic14`` member set and ignores a ``sizes=``
argument, so the quality knob that actually works is ``append_images``: every
member we hand it is used verbatim instead of Pillow's own default-resampled
resize. That is why this script renders all six distinct sizes itself.
