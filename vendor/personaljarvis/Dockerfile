# Personal Jarvis — headless server image (the cloud-first / VPS path).
#
# Boots the FastAPI + WebSocket backend and serves the prebuilt browser UI, so a
# user reaches the full Router-Brain experience through any browser without a
# desktop install. NO desktop extras (tray, overlay, hotkey, local voice) — those
# are opt-in and useless in a headless container (see CLAUDE.md, cloud-first
# doctrine). Bring your own provider keys via environment variables.
#
#   docker build -t personal-jarvis .
#   docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \

#   # then open http://localhost:8000
#
# Or use the bundled docker-compose.yml.

# --- Stage 1: build the React UI ---------------------------------------------
# The frontend source lives in the repo; build it once here so the runtime image
# carries a ready-to-serve dist/ and needs no Node.
# Mirror the package layout, including the shared marketplace catalog imported
# by the frontend. Vite writes the bundle next to the frontend directory.
