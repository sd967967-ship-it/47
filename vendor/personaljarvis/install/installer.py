"""Personal Jarvis Stage-2 installer.

The Stage-1 shell bootstraps a venv with ``rich`` + ``packaging`` and then
``exec``s this script with the venv's Python. From here we own the full
install lifecycle in Python, where it is portable and testable.

The installer is fully NON-INTERACTIVE: it downloads and prepares everything,
explains each step in one line, and launches the app as its LAST action. All
setup questions (language, wake word, API keys, Terms) live in the app's
one-time first-launch onboarding — never in this terminal.

The user-visible journey is ONE six-phase sequence spanning both stages: the
Stage-1 shell prints phases 1-3 (prerequisites, fetch, venv), this script
continues with 4-6. Keep the numbering in sync with install.sh / install.ps1.

Phases owned here:
    4/6 Dependencies — editable install + runtime deps via pip. Desktop hosts
        (Windows/macOS/Linux, or ``--with-desktop``) get the ``[full]`` extras;
        headless keeps the torch-free base floor.
    5/6 Voice models — prefetch everything the config needs (``python -m
        jarvis --prefetch``) + verify what actually landed on disk.
    6/6 Finish & launch — best-effort worker CLI (npm) + native desktop-shell
        registration + UI-bundle integrity check, then the flat summary, then
        launch the Desktop App / headless server as the LAST action unless
        ``--no-launch``.

Environment variables (any can be set before re-invoking the installer):
    JARVIS_INSTALL_DIR      override install location
    JARVIS_INSTALL_NO_PIP   skip the pip install steps

Exit codes:
    0  success
    1  pre-flight failure (Python version, missing files)
    2  pip install failure
    4  desktop registration or launch failure
    5  shipped UI bundle missing or incomplete
