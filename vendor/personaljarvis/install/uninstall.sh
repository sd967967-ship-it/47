#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Personal Jarvis — macOS / Linux uninstaller
#
# Usage (from any POSIX shell), on a machine where Jarvis is installed:
#   bash ~/.personal-jarvis/install/uninstall.sh
#   bash ~/.personal-jarvis/install/uninstall.sh --dry-run   # preview only
#   bash ~/.personal-jarvis/install/uninstall.sh --yes       # no prompt
#
# It removes four things a plain folder-delete would miss:
#   1. the install folder (~/.personal-jarvis)
#   2. the macOS app bundle or Linux application-menu entry
#   3. the login-autostart entry (~/.config/autostart or ~/Library/LaunchAgents)
#   4. the API keys saved in the OS keychain (service "personal-jarvis")
#
# Heavy logic lives in `python -m jarvis --uninstall` (cross-platform, tested).
# This bootstrap runs that for the autostart + keys (it asks for confirmation),
# then removes the folder itself from OUTSIDE the venv so nothing is locked.

set -euo pipefail

# Standalone fallback projections of jarvis/core/branding.py. These remain
# available even when a broken venv prevents importing the installed package.
