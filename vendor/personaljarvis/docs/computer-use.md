# Computer-Use And Local Desktop Routing

Status: 2026-08-10. ADR: [0008](adr/0008-computer-use-harness-in-process.md).

This page documents the current routing model for desktop actions. The main
goal is to keep simple local actions deterministic and fast, while preserving
POAV Computer-Use and Jarvis-Agents for the work that actually needs them.

## Engine v2 (default since 2026-07-02)

The POAV Computer-Use engine was rebuilt from scratch as the modular package
`jarvis/cu/` and is the default (`[computer_use].engine = "v2"`). The product
mechanism is unchanged — a screenshot is the perception, mouse + keyboard are
the actuation — but the structural defects of the legacy monolith are fixed:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `jarvis/cu/geometry.py` | One `CoordinateMapper` per captured frame (model space -> image space -> screen input units, negative virtual-desktop origins and Retina points included) + the thread DPI pin that keeps capture, metrics and input in ONE coordinate space on mixed-DPI Windows. |
| `jarvis/cu/capture.py` | UI-idle stable-frame capture (bounded re-grab until two area-filtered thumbnails match), one call-scoped capture session per frame, deferred BGRX conversion, and reducing-gap downscale to `[computer_use].image_max_dimension` (default 1366). |
| `jarvis/cu/conventions.py` | Coordinate conventions as a per-provider capability: Gemini family emits a 0-1000 normalized grid, Claude/OpenAI emit pixels on the sent image. Prompt block AND parsing derive from one resolution (`[computer_use].coordinate_space` pins it). |
| `jarvis/cu/actuate/` | Platform-native input: Windows SendInput with absolute virtual-desktop positioning, macOS/Linux-X11 via pynput (points/pixels, no primary-screen clamping), Wayland/headless refuse honestly. `verified_move` turns silent misses into diagnosable failures; cursor animation remains configurable but adds no delay by default. |
| `jarvis/cu/verify.py` | Pixel/UI comparison primitives, accessibility read-back after typing, focus confirmation, and human-handoff detection. The engine polls compact local/global probes and requires a persistent second observation before accepting a visual effect. |
| `jarvis/cu/ledger.py` | Idempotency ledger: an action that already executed against a visually identical screen is refused deterministically — the double-type/double-click killer. |
| `jarvis/cu/engine.py` | The perceive->act->verify state machine; one pointer action per frame; a failed effect check truncates the batch and forces re-perception; verified-done judge with the proof spoken in the user's language. Exit codes and readback contract match the legacy engine. |

Rollback is one config line: `[computer_use].engine = "current"` (last legacy
loop) or `"stable"` / `"june13"` (frozen snapshots). The engine is resolved
per mission — no restart needed.

**Measurement rig:** `python scripts/cu_test_rig.py --mode raw` proves the
coordinate pipeline on the current machine (known-geometry tkinter targets,
runs on Windows/macOS/Linux); `--mode engine --engine v2|stable|current`
compares the real engines with a scripted brain (accuracy, duplicate-action
rate, per-step latency). `scripts/cu_bench.py` remains the end-to-end
benchmark with live models.

**2026-08-10 latency result:** on the same four-target engine rig, the tracked
HEAD baseline took 7.30 s. Three post-change runs took 2.20 s, 2.36 s and
2.69 s (median 2.36 s, **3.09x faster**). Every run delivered 4/4 first-hit
clicks, zero duplicate clicks, exact-once typing, and zero blind repeat after
the deliberate miss. A final run after the review-driven safety fixes took
2.41 s (**3.03x**) with the same perfect oracles. The speed claim is tied to
those accuracy oracles, not to the scripted completion message.

## Routing Model

Jarvis now has four distinct routes for commands that may touch the desktop.

| Route | Use for | Must not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct Fast Path | One local action such as open an app, type into the active window, send a hotkey, move/click explicit coordinates | Call a provider, collect vision, infer visual targets |
| Scripted Fast Path | Known deterministic multi-step local workflows such as opening several terminals or starting a Jarvis-Agent in a terminal | Invent coordinates, ask a provider to plan, run shell commands for vague UI goals |
| POAV Computer-Use | Visual or ambiguous UI navigation such as "click Send", "write this into the ChatGPT input", or "find the settings button" | Handle heavy coding/research delegation or long-running autonomous work |
| Jarvis-Agents | Heavy code, repo, research, worker, or long-running delegated tasks | Execute simple desktop controls that the local fast path can do directly |

The fast paths run before normal provider routing. If the local action gate
matches, BrainManager executes hidden local tools through the existing
ToolExecutor instead of exposing those tools to the router model.

## Direct Fast Path

Direct Fast Path is for atomic commands with a clear target:

- `Mach Spotify auf`
- `Oeffne Windows Terminal`
- `Starte Notepad`
- Type text into the already active window
- Send a hotkey to the already active window

Latency target:

- It should not call a Brain provider.
- It should not collect screenshots or UIA vision.
- It should usually finish dispatch in under one second; app startup itself can
  take longer and is outside the dispatch budget.

Operational boundary:

- The command must already name the app or active-window operation.
- The route may use `open_app`, `type_text`, `hotkey`, `click`,
  `move_mouse`, `switch_window`, or `dispatch_to_harness` only when wired as
  hidden local-action tools.
- Visual target phrases such as "click the Send button" are not direct fast
  path commands because the system must observe the screen first.

Expected log evidence:

- A local-action fast-path match before provider turn startup.
- No provider turn before the direct tool execution.
- No Computer-Use planner vision attachment for direct open/type/hotkey work.

## Scripted Fast Path

Scripted Fast Path is still local and deterministic, but it contains more than
one step. Examples:

- Open three terminals.
- Open Windows Terminal, type `claude`, press Enter.
- Start a Jarvis-Agent and pass a bounded prompt in the terminal.

Latency target:

- It should not call a provider.
- It should not collect vision.
- It should dispatch quickly; total user-visible time may include short waits
  between terminal launch, typing, and hotkey steps.

Operational boundary:

- Scripts must be hard-coded patterns with bounded step counts.
- The route must not guess screen coordinates or visual state.
- If a workflow becomes ambiguous, visual, or app-state dependent, route it to
  POAV Computer-Use instead of expanding the script.

## POAV Computer-Use

POAV means Plan, Observe, Act, Verify. This route is implemented by the
in-process `computer-use` harness and is the right path when Jarvis needs to see
the UI before acting.

Use POAV Computer-Use for:

- Clicking a named UI element.
- Filling a field that must be found visually or via UIA.
- Navigating an application where the current state is not known.
- Recovering from a failed local script when observation is required.

Boundary:

- POAV may collect screenshots and UIA trees.
- POAV may ask the configured planner/step model for a plan or verification.
- POAV is slower than the fast path by design.
- POAV should stay bounded by `[computer_use]` step, replan, and timeout
  settings.

## Jarvis-Agents

Jarvis-Agents is for delegated agent work, not low-latency desktop control.

Use Jarvis-Agents for:

- Codebase changes and reviews.
- Multi-file research or investigation.
- Long-running autonomous tasks.
- Work that needs external agent isolation, terminals, or repo-level context.

Boundary:

- Do not route simple "open app", "type this", or "press this hotkey" commands
  to Jarvis-Agents.
- Do not route visual UI control to Jarvis-Agents when the POAV Computer-Use harness
  is the intended desktop-control mechanism.

## Configuration

Fast-path behavior is controlled separately from POAV Computer-Use:

```toml
[local_action]
enabled = true
direct_timeout_s = 2.0
harness_timeout_s = 20.0
max_scripted_steps = 10

[computer_use]
enabled = true
cursor_glide_ms = 0  # set a positive value to opt into cursor animation
max_steps = 100
max_replans = 2
per_step_timeout_s = 30.0
mission_timeout_s = 600.0  # wall-clock ceiling for one whole mission
verify_after_each_step = true
step_budget = 100
```

`mission_timeout_s` bounds a whole mission, `per_step_timeout_s` a single step.
Raise it for long GUI flows; lower it to cut runaway missions short. It is read
when the brain is built, so a change applies after a restart.

`ROUTER_TOOLS` should remain a pure router-visible dispatcher set. Direct local
tools are loaded separately as hidden BrainManager tools so the model does not
need to decide among OS-control primitives for simple local commands.

## Safety

- Direct and scripted fast paths still execute through ToolExecutor and the
  existing tool risk tiers.
- The fast path must not use `run_shell` for implicit desktop actions.
- Destructive commands are out of scope for the smoke script and for this
  routing model.
- PyAutoGUI failsafe still applies where pyautogui is used: move the mouse to
  the upper-left corner to abort a running GUI action.

## Smoke Validation

Dry-run validation:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/smoke_computer_use_fast_path.ps1 -WhatIf
```

The smoke script:

- Compiles and imports the local-action, app-resolver, and direct tool modules.
- Parses representative direct, scripted, and POAV-routing examples where the
  current gate supports them.
- Reports whether `claude` or `claude.cmd` is on PATH.
- In `-WhatIf`, describes the Notepad/type/hotkey checks without launching apps
  or sending input.
- Without `-WhatIf`, opens Notepad, types `jarvis-smoke`, selects it, deletes
  it, and exits non-zero only for these core checks.

Manual validation checklist:

1. `Mach Spotify auf`
   Expected: direct fast path, no provider call, no vision collection.
2. `Hey Nova, can you open Spotify?`
   Expected: direct fast path, not smalltalk.
3. `How can I open Chrome?`
   Expected: no app launch; normal answer path.
4. `Click the Send button`
   Expected: POAV Computer-Use with the original prompt.
5. `Open three terminals`
   Expected: scripted fast path if supported by the current gate; otherwise no
   provider-side coordinate guessing.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clicks "succeed" but nothing on screen reacts | An ELEVATED (admin) window holds the foreground: Windows UIPI silently discards input injected by a non-elevated Jarvis | Close/unfocus the elevated app, or run Jarvis elevated; the v2 effect check reports the miss instead of typing on |
| Direct command calls a provider | Local-action gate did not match or `[local_action].enabled` is false | Check local-action logs and gate patterns |
| Direct command collects vision | Command was classified as visual/ambiguous | Confirm the utterance names a direct app or active-window action |
| `claude` launch fails | Claude CLI is not on PATH | Install Claude CLI or add `claude.cmd` to PATH |
| Notepad smoke types into the wrong window | Focus changed after launch | Re-run smoke with no manual focus changes |
| POAV is slow | Expected for observe/plan/verify path | Use direct/scripted phrasing for deterministic local actions |
