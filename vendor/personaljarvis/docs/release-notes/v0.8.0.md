# v0.8.0 — Review-Pipeline (Phase 8)

**As of:** 2026-04-28
**Branch:** `phase-8-review-pipeline` → ready for merge to `main`
**Plan:** Private review plan (later materialized as `JARVIS_REVIEW_AGENT_PLAN.md`)

## Summary

Personal Jarvis gets a **quality-gate pipeline** that has the outputs of
the Jarvis-Agent worker validated by a
read-only review subagent before delivery to the user. On `needs_revision` the
worker is re-tasked with structured feedback (max 3 iterations).
Selective activation via tool description — smalltalk and tool calls
continue to run inline.

Pattern: evaluator-optimizer from Anthropic's "Building Effective
Agents" documentation. Worker = Sonnet 4.7, reviewer = Opus 4.7
(cross-capability instead of cross-family — Phase-9 backlog).

## Added

- **Quality-gate tool** `dispatch_with_review` as a main-Jarvis router tool
  (5th position in `ROUTER_TOOLS`). Selective activation via tool
  description (Plan §AD-6); the LLM decides per utterance.
- **Worker and reviewer subagents** under `.claude/agents/`. Reviewer
  tool allowlist hardcoded to `Read, Grep, Glob` (Plan §AD-2:
  read-only).
- **Pipeline mechanics**: pre-check → worker → post-check → reviewer →
  verdict branch. Cap-fire fallback with best-of pick (Plan §AD-7: never
  fail-closed).
- **`openclaw` harness** as a new plugin (`jarvis.harness` entry point).
  Spawns with `--bare`, `--agent <name>`, `--allowedTools`, `--json-schema`,
  `--effort`, `--max-budget-usd` (AD-13: `--max-turns` surrogate for
  claude-CLI 2.1.x).
- **Filesystem IPC** under `data/review/runs/<run_id>/`: `task.json`,
  `iter-N/worker.out`, `iter-N/verdict.json`, `final.json`. The reviewer
  gets only the path, reads it itself via the `Read` tool (Plan §AD-9).
- **Append-only audit log** `data/review.log` (JSON-Lines, threading.Lock,
  a separate store from run artifacts — Plan §AD-11).
- **Read-only UI** under the sidebar "Review" with three tabs (Recent Runs,
  Run Detail, Stats). Three GET endpoints plus a stats cache (60s).
- **GC CLI** `jarvis-review-gc` with `--older-than`, `--dry-run`,
  `--keep-passing`, `--keep-cap-fired`. Recovery buffer for
  half-finished runs (no `final.json` → never deleted).
- **Eval harness** `jarvis-review-eval` with 20 golden queries in 6
  buckets (`code_gen_trivial/complex`, `skill_authoring`, `research`,
  `adversarial`, `edge_case`). Mock and real mode. Pre-commit hook
  triggers a quick subset (5 queries, mock, < 1s).
- **Voice phrases** (AD-14): holding phrase via the `AnnouncementRequested`
  bus event before pipeline start; `voice_completion_phrase` in the ToolResult
  based on outcome (success/cap_fired/fail/precheck_fail).
- **`ReviewConfig`** in `jarvis.toml` `[review]` section with
  `max_iterations` (1-5, hard ceiling 5), 4 default rubrics.
- **Self-mod allowlist forbidden**: `review.*` paths are explicitly
  NOT mutable via voice/chat (Plan §AD-1).

## Architecture Decisions

14 ADs in the plan, of which 2 were added during implementation:

- **AD-13** (Phase 8.3): `--max-turns` surrogate via `--effort` +
  `--max-budget-usd` + `HarnessTask.timeout_s`, because claude-CLI 2.1.x
  removed `--max-turns`.
- **AD-14** (Phase 8.7): voice-phrase wording kept constant
  ("Lass mich kurz an der Aufgabe arbeiten." / "Erledigt — {summary}" / <!-- i18n-allow -->
  "Mein bestes Ergebnis liegt vor, mit einer Einschränkung: {top_issue}"). <!-- i18n-allow -->

The other 12 ADs are taken over unchanged from the plan — no
architecture drift.

## Test Status

- `pytest tests/review/ tests/eval/ -m "not e2e"`: 201 passed, 14 skipped
- `pytest tests/eval/ -m eval`: 8 passed, 1 skipped (real-eval ohne auth)
- `pytest tests/e2e/test_voice_review_pipeline.py -m e2e`: 5/5 passed
- `jarvis-review-eval --quick --mock`: match_rate=80% n=5 < 1s
- `jarvis-review-eval` voll (Mock): 95% match-rate (19/20)

## Skipped

- 13 UI-routes tests (FastAPI 0.119.1 + Starlette 1.0.0 incompatible —
  pre-existing, identical bug in `tests/board/*`, `tests/missions/api/*`).
- 2 E2E tests against a real claude spawn (no auth in local pytest env).

## Backlog (Phase 9)

- Cross-family reviewer (Gemini Flash) — eliminates self-preference bias
- Training critic (own fine-tuned model) — out-of-scope for single-user
- Reviewer memory (`data/review/lessons.md`) — risky, suspended
- Token-based cost monitoring in the eval harness (Phase 8.6 records
  tokens but does not assert on them)
- Parallelism > 1 in the eval run (currently at 1 for reproducibility)
