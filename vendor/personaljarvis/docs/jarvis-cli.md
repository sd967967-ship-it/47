# The Jarvis CLI

`jarvis` is a command-line interface to a **running** Personal Jarvis instance. It
exposes the same action surface as the desktop WebUI, so anything you can click in
the UI you can also do from a terminal — and, more importantly, so can an external
coding agent (Claude Code, Codex) or a script.

This is the same relationship `gcloud` / `aws` / `az` have with their cloud
platforms: a single CLI that surfaces the full capability plane of a service. You
point it at a running Jarvis and drive it.

## How it works

The CLI is a **thin HTTP client over the REST API**, in two layers:

1. **Dynamic layer (`jarvis api <tag> <op>`)** — every mounted REST endpoint is
   surfaced automatically from the server's OpenAPI spec. New features become
   commands with no extra code. This is what guarantees *every* WebUI action is
   reachable.
2. **Curated layer (`jarvis <group> <command>`)** — hand-written, ergonomic
   commands for the common domains: `brain`, `config`, `missions`, `wiki`,
   `sessions`, `skills`, `outputs`, `board`, `costs`, `workflows`, `conductor`,
   `contacts`, `telephony`, `marketplace`, `mcps`, `docs`, `frontier`,
   `local-models`, plus `auth`, `system`, `tasks`.

Because the CLI only ever calls the same routes the WebUI calls, it inherits all
of Jarvis's safety machinery (risk tiers, the atomic config-write pipeline, the
event bus, audit) for free — it cannot bypass a guardrail it never re-implements.

It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (pure-Python: `typer`, `httpx`,
`platformdirs`, `rich` — all base dependencies), including a headless VPS.

## Install

The CLI ships with the package, so after the normal install it is on your PATH:

```bash
pip install -e .            # provides the `jarvis` binary (aliases: jarvisctl, jctl)
jarvis version
```

Bare `jarvis` (no subcommand) still launches the app/tray as before; `jarvis serve`
still starts the headless server. Only the control subcommands (`jarvis missions
…`, `jarvis brain …`, etc.) route into the CLI.

## Auth & discovery

**Local is zero-config.** When Jarvis is running on the same machine, the desktop
app writes its live port + control token to a single-instance session file; the
CLI discovers it automatically (and falls back to the machine's control key). Just
run commands:

```bash
jarvis system status        # {"reachable": true} when Jarvis is up
jarvis --json brain status
```

Resolution order (highest first): explicit `--url` / `--key` → `JARVISCTL_BASE_URL`
/ `JARVISCTL_CONTROL_KEY` env → saved profile (`jarvis auth login`) → the live
session file → the local control key + default `127.0.0.1:47821`.

**Remote / VPS.** Tunnel the loopback port and the CLI treats it as local:

```bash
ssh -L 47821:127.0.0.1:47821 <host>
```

Or save a remote profile (the key is read from a hidden prompt — never an inline
argument that would land in shell history):

```bash
jarvis auth login --url https://jarvis.example:47821
# (prompts for the control key; or: echo "$JCTL" | jarvis auth login --url … --key -)
```

## Output

Put `--json` **before** the group for machine-readable output; omit it for human
tables:

```bash
jarvis --json missions list          # JSON, for scripts/agents
jarvis missions list                 # rich table, for humans
```

## Installing from the marketplace

A marketplace page prints one line to copy. It works for every kind of entry —
skills, plugins and wallpapers — and you never have to know which one you are
looking at:

```bash
jarvis marketplace install three-bullet-brief
jarvis marketplace browse                       # everything on offer + what you have
```

At a terminal the command first shows what the entry is and where it comes from,
asks once, and then says plainly what happened. What "installed" is worth differs
per kind, and the answer says which one you got: a skill that validated is usable
immediately, a wallpaper is in your picker straight away, and a plugin lands on
your list but stays powerless until you connect your account. **Exit code 1 means
"not usable"**: an unknown name, a declined prompt, or a skill whose file failed
validation. Piped or with `--json` it skips the prose and the prompt and prints
the API payload (`POST /api/marketplace/community/install/<name>`).

The same install is reachable by just asking for it — "install the wallpaper
rain-antenna-city" — because both the browse and the install are Command-Registry
entries (`marketplace-browse`, `marketplace-install`), so the assistant can look
the name up and then install it. Installing pulls somebody else's published
content onto your machine, so that path asks you to confirm out loud first.

## Local models from the terminal

The "Local models" section — what is installed on the pull-capable local server
(Ollama today), which download fills each role, per-model option profiles, the
public catalogue, Hugging Face GGUF browsing and the server itself — is one
curated group. The provider defaults to `ollama`; `--provider <id>` names
another pull-capable card (a cloud card answers with a sentence, never an empty
table):

```bash
jarvis local-models roles                          # chat / tools_screen / deep / embedding
jarvis local-models roles set deep qwen3:32b
jarvis local-models models                         # every download, what is loaded, disk total
jarvis local-models models show qwen3:32b
jarvis local-models models unload qwen3:32b --yes  # frees memory; the next turn reloads
jarvis local-models models delete old:7b --reassign qwen3:32b --yes
jarvis local-models options set qwen3:32b num_ctx=16384 temperature=0.2 think=false
jarvis local-models options suggest qwen3:32b     # an advisory profile for this machine
jarvis local-models catalog search "vision" --capability vision
jarvis local-models catalog tags qwen3
jarvis local-models catalog recommended
jarvis local-models hf enable on                   # off by default; nothing calls huggingface.co until then
jarvis local-models hf search "llama 3.1 gguf"
jarvis local-models hf files bartowski Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF
jarvis local-models hf pull bartowski Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF --quant Q4_K_M
jarvis local-models server status
jarvis local-models server test http://127.0.0.1:11434
jarvis local-models server verify                  # the server, one real chat answer, one real embedding
jarvis local-models server autostart off           # on by default; fires only while local models are in use
jarvis local-models server log --lines 80
jarvis local-models server env-guide --os linux
jarvis local-models server stop --yes              # only a server Jarvis itself started
```

`options set` replaces the whole profile: `KEY=VALUE` pairs are typed (numbers,
`true`/`false`, JSON lists such as `stop='["</s>"]'`), and the writer clamps the
values rather than rejecting them. Deleting a download is refused with a 409
while a configured role still points at it, unless `--reassign` names another
installed model — then the roles are rewritten first, and the delete runs only
on a valid config. `--json` before the group prints the untouched API payload.

## Safety model

The CLI is agent-first, so it stays out of your way for safe work and only gates
the genuinely consequential:

- **Reads** (`GET`) and **reversible mutations** (switch provider, set language,
  enable a skill) just run.
- **Destructive** actions — every `DELETE`, plus `config set`, `missions dispatch`,
  `telephony outbound`, `local-models models unload` and `local-models server
  stop` — refuse unless you pass `--yes` (or set
  `JARVIS_CLI_ASSUME_YES=1`). A prompt is not an accepted substitute.
- **Desktop restart is UI-only.** Control/API clients, including
  `jarvis system restart`, cannot restart the app even with `--yes --force`;
  the maintainer must click Restart in the desktop UI. This preserves live
  Agentic-IDE terminals and makes human presence explicit.
- `--dry-run` on any command prints the exact request (method, path, body, whether
  auth is attached) and sends nothing — the safe way to inspect before acting.
- Secrets are never accepted as inline arguments; they are read from a hidden
  prompt or stdin and stored in the OS credential store.

## Driving Jarvis from a Claude Code / Codex session

This is a first-class use case. An external coding agent can control your running
Jarvis end-to-end through its shell:

1. **It's already installed and authenticated.** After `pip install -e .` the
   `jarvis` binary is on PATH, and local auth is zero-config (session-file
   discovery). The agent runs `jarvis system status` to confirm Jarvis is up.
2. **It discovers the surface** with `jarvis --help`, `jarvis <group> --help`, and
   `jarvis api --help` for the full generated list.
3. **It reads with `--json`** and parses, and **acts with explicit intent**, using
   `--dry-run` to preview and `--yes` to authorize destructive actions.

Worked example — switch the brain provider, then dispatch a mission:

```bash
jarvis --json brain status                       # see the active provider
jarvis brain switch openai                        # reversible → runs immediately
jarvis brain subagent-switch openai               # switch the worker provider too
jarvis missions dispatch "summarize today's PRs" --yes   # destructive → needs --yes
jarvis --json missions list --state RUNNING       # watch it
```

The `drive-jarvis-cli` skill (in `.claude/skills/`) packages these conventions so
an agent can pick them up automatically.

## Extending the CLI

When you add a REST route for a new feature, it becomes CLI-reachable
automatically via the dynamic layer — provided the router is **mounted**. The
`generate-cli-command` skill is the "definition of done" checklist; the
`scripts/ci/check_cli_coverage.py` gate fails CI/pre-push if a route module is
defined but never mounted (an unreachable feature). Run
`scripts/ci/gen_cli_reference.py` to refresh the reference after adding commands.
