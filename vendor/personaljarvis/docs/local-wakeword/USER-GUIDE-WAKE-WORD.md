# How to Set Your Wake Word

Personal Jarvis ships **no built-in wake word**. You pick any phrase you like
during onboarding (or later in Settings); the recognizer is fully generic and
runs entirely on your machine — wake-word listening never sends audio to the
cloud. For the engineering rationale behind the detection paths, see
[`CUSTOM-WAKE-WORD-DESIGN.md`](CUSTOM-WAKE-WORD-DESIGN.md).

## Where to set it

1. **Desktop app** — the first-run onboarding has a wake-word step, and
   **Settings → Wake word** changes it any time. The desktop flow fixes the
   "Hey" prefix and you type the rest ("Hey" + your word); a prefixed phrase
   is what keeps the bare word in normal conversation from waking Jarvis.
   Prefer no wake word at all? The onboarding also offers activation through
   the configurable Call shortcut instead.
2. **Terminal wizard** — `python -m jarvis --wizard` for SSH / headless
   setups. Headless installs can also complete the same onboarding in the
   browser UI.

Both paths write to the same place — `[trigger.wake_word]` in `jarvis.toml` —
so they are interchangeable.

## How recognition works (engine "auto")

Every phrase goes through the same generic chain — no word is special:

1. **Your own trained model** (`custom_onnx`) — if you supplied a custom
   `.onnx` model for exactly this phrase, it wins (fastest, most accurate).
2. **Any-word keyword spotting (Vosk)** — works offline on every machine,
   CPU-only, no training. A small per-language model (~45 MB) is downloaded
   once at setup.
3. **Local-Whisper transcript match** (`stt_match`) — a higher-accuracy path
   that transcribes short audio windows and fuzzy-matches your phrase
   (tolerates small mishearings). Part of the full install.
4. **Honest degrade** — if none of these can serve your phrase on this
   machine, the wake word stays **off** and Jarvis says so clearly. There is
   no hidden fallback word; use the Call shortcut until a local engine is
   available.

You normally never need to choose an engine by hand — leave it on `auto`.

## No trademark words

Pick any word — just make sure it isn't someone else's trademark. The product
ships no pre-trained brand models and never downloads one.

## Applying a change

Saving a wake-word change or switching always-on wake listening on/off applies
to a running desktop voice pipeline immediately. Hotkeys remain available and
unchanged throughout the switch. In a headless or voice-disabled process there
is no live microphone pipeline to update, so the setting is stored for the next
voice start instead.

## Quick reference

| You want | Do this |
|---|---|
| Change the wake word | Settings → Wake word (or first-run onboarding) |
| Best accuracy for your word | Train/supply a custom `.onnx` (`custom_onnx`) |
| No wake word, manual activation | Choose the Call-shortcut path |
| Wake word "stopped working" | Run `python -m jarvis.speech.diagnose` |
