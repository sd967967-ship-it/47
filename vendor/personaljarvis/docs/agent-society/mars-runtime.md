# Mars runtime reference

Status: development reference, not the completed colony. **Agents > Map** opens
Mars directly in both normal and Dev instances and offers no previous-world
selector, including when an older URL requests another world. The Agents workspace and communications-station
controls remain separate from rendering. Final character/rover art, player
boarding and remaining districts are unfinished.
The art study has no user visual approval and must not be rolled out by family.

The communications-station button is available in the Agents workspace
without mounting the map or selecting a preview first. Browser fullscreen exit preserves a focused Mars
form or player view; use the Agents tab to leave that view explicitly.

## Boundaries

The packaged `jarvis/society/mars/definition.json` defines metre/Y-up placement,
stable district/building/station IDs and navigation version. The frontend copy
is synchronized by `python scripts/sync_mars_definition.py --check` and a
contract test. No old-world terrain or figure art is the new visual foundation.
Existing agent IDs, custom imports, recipes and old-world preferences remain
unchanged. Existing world URL parameters cannot restore the retired map surface.

The communications console accepts a bounded draft request through the existing
Society scheduler and the chosen agent's read-only chat runner. It does not send
mail or publish content. Credential-shaped input is rejected before persistence.
Request identity, station ownership, fencing and task/result references are
durable; failed or uncertain outcomes never become animation-driven success.
The renderer is not an execution dependency. Unknown outcomes are reconciled
without blindly repeating dispatch or cancellation.

The `mars` OpenAPI group provides definition, snapshot, bounded cursor events,
draft submission and scoped cancellation, plus physical visit snapshots,
pedestrian visit requests and movement-only stops. Dynamic CLI discovery respects the
selected server and isolates cached schemas by its full base URL. Example:

```text
jarvis --url http://127.0.0.1:47869 api mars --help
jarvis --url http://127.0.0.1:47869 --json api mars get-mars-snapshot
jarvis --url http://127.0.0.1:47869 --json api mars get-mars-navigation-snapshot
```

## Physical visits

The communications panel can send a real active roster member to the console,
operations entrance or bridge waiting area. Visiting does not start a provider
turn, and stopping a visit does not cancel the agent's work. A stopped agent
remains physically present; moving it to the bridge waiting area frees the
console route. The entrance is a usable destination on that route, so waiting
there deliberately blocks through traffic.

Visit identity, graph version, position and occupancy are durable. Physical
bodies survive intent-lease expiry, cancellation and process restart; only
actual departure clears their occupied resources. Movement rechecks roster
authority and the kill switch. Routes, snapshots and actor counts are bounded.
The process advances movement independently of renderer frames and draft-task
inspection; clients display confirmed positions, with only short interpolation
on the same graph segment. Spawn queues are not rendered as physical actors.
The visit API remains pedestrian-only. Rover journeys have a separate explicit
reservation and boarding contract, described below.

The renderer currently uses named location markers while final worker art is
pending. An optional Gigi companion uses the existing assistant's presentation
state and opens its existing chat. It creates no second assistant or audio
session. Camera focus requests live outside the Canvas so graphics recovery
cannot replay an already-consumed focus action.

Choose an agent in the follow control or beside its location marker to follow
its confirmed position. The camera keeps the same identity across replacement
visits and holds its last confirmed view offline. A fresh snapshot showing a
missing actor ends follow safely. Stopping a visit leaves its physical actor
present; stopping camera follow does not change the visit or the agent's work.
Dragging the view, choosing another camera mode, focusing Gigi or pressing
Escape in the focused viewport relinquishes follow. Browser fullscreen exit
also stops focused follow while preserving the map and unrelated forms.
Follow identity and camera preferences are local to the client and world.

## Route-driven rover development slice

The communications panel exposes one rover for real active roster agents. Reserve
its seat, wait for the agent to reach the boarding anchor, explicitly board, and
choose Operations approach or South overlook. The two stops share the existing
Outpost road. Stop retains the vehicle and passenger in place; Exit succeeds only
at a stopped dock with a free, supported exit. If the primary exit is occupied,
the server checks the alternative. An interrupted response retains the exact
request identity for an explicit retry, including after the original agent is
archived. New actions still require current authority.

This is a functional transport slice with location labels. Final authored rover
geometry, animations and player boarding remain unfinished. The local walk
controller is not a server-owned passenger. Camera selection does not release a
seat, and an attached agent has no second pedestrian body at its earlier location.
Agent work continues through the existing scheduler independently of travel.

Seats, bodies, ride receipts and pedestrian/vehicle conflict resources use one
transaction in `navigation.db`. The existing process owner advances journeys with
zero clients. Process downtime preserves exact placement; ten-minute wall-clock
deadlines continue to expire. Expiry cancels an unboarded reservation or stops a
boarded journey without dropping its passenger. A new travel action starts a fresh
bounded journey. Revoked authority stops motion; it does not silently erase a body.

Packaged support and wall geometry is projected from the authored Outpost contract
with `python scripts/art/project_mars_collision.py --check`. Graph subdivisions
retain the existing rendered roads. A stored placement migrates only when its
source graph and unchanged geometry can be proved. An unmapped physical body
stops further motion and admission until a valid migration is available; changed
edge identifiers cannot make the old obstacle disappear.

The dynamic `mars` CLI group exposes `reserve-mars-rover`, `board-mars-rover`,
`travel-mars-rover`, `cancel-mars-rover` and `exit-mars-rover`. Use the named agent
and ride identifiers and preserve `request_id` when retrying an uncertain action.
These controls never dispatch a model task or allow animation to grant a seat.

The `ea3aab13a` installed wheel passed fourteen headless checks in a fresh Linux
venv, including actual rover boarding, route completion, safe exit and completed
action replay. A separate one-key communication draft completed with durable
references and clean shutdown. These operational checks do not establish visual
quality, player boarding or a browser walkthrough of the rover controls.

## Window ownership

Background mode is explicit, default-off and session-only. On supported Windows
hosts it requires persistent WebView storage and confirmed native tray presence.
Closing the real client window then retains a blank hidden GUI keeper and the
owning backend. Reopening restores a new authenticated window; disabling the
mode restores the ordinary close-to-quit policy. Explicit Quit still ends work.
Browser-dependent voice is not retained by the keeper.

Other desktop backends currently report this mode unavailable until native tray
registration can be proved. Their ordinary windows and headless server remain
available. No Windows SYSTEM service or server-side graphics renderer is added.
Local work cannot continue when its execution host is stopped or asleep.

Windows native closure/reopening and a real draft continuing after window
destruction have been measured. A clean installed wheel in an isolated Linux
venv also completed real station work with one Gemini key, no display, graphics
GPU, browser or Blender, and retained the result after clean process shutdown.
Direct tray-menu interaction, other native OSes, host sleep/reboot and final graphics/performance
acceptance are still open; the private issue tracker retains the full ledger.

## Restart recovery

An existing `mars/ordinary.db` or `mars/navigation.db` under the configured data directory schedules
recovery after the server boot chain yields. No browser tab, desktop renderer or
HTTP request is needed to start that recovery. An installation without either
journal does not construct the Society runtime or create Mars storage for it.
The initial HTTP request and deferred recovery share one application-owned
initialization task with a thirty-second deadline, service and journal owner.
An individual HTTP disconnect cannot cancel initialization for other waiters.
Explicit server stop fences late initialization, cancels and joins the owned
startup/reconciliation/movement tasks, then closes both journals before Society shutdown.
A collaborator that ignores cancellation produces an explicit shutdown timeout
after five seconds; it cannot publish a late station owner. The server retains
the Mars stop latch and task references, completes independent browser, chat,
plugin, watcher, terminal and server teardown, then reports the incomplete Mars
cleanup. A Mars timeout must not leave those unrelated resources running.

Society teardown also fences lazy creation before its first await, rejects late
roster requests, and releases the complete runtime and SQLite connection.
Browser cleanup retains ownership and terminates its children even when graceful
shutdown is cancelled. These paths have real-process and startup-race regressions.
In the installed Linux navigation run, boot took 6.013 seconds and graceful exit
took 1.823 seconds; the separate single-key draft run exited in 0.916 seconds.
These are observations of those runs, not latency guarantees.

Acknowledged queued requests are checked against current agent authority before
dispatch. Previously owned work receives a new fence and an interruption event;
the existing executor inspects its stable command/task identity rather than
dispatching it again. Completed result references remain unchanged. An outcome
the executor cannot establish stays uncertain and holds the station for
reconciliation; this does not promise exactly-once external effects.

The portable lifecycle contract exercises separate abrupt-exit and recovery
processes at queued, active and result-committed checkpoints, using real SQLite
and a clearly labeled test executor. It also covers concurrent first access,
authority revocation, startup/shutdown races and private error logging. This is
local process-failure evidence; actual host power loss, sleep/reboot, unavailable
provider recovery and live external-outcome reconciliation remain separate
acceptance work. SQLite rollback is joined even if cancellation occurs while
BEGIN is executing or a second cancellation arrives during rollback, before
the connection lock is released for reuse. No OS-specific lifecycle API or new execution scheduler is
introduced by this recovery path.

## Art and verification

Editable Blender source, recipes and isolated exports live in
`art/studies/mars-outpost-reference`. Runtime users need only the packaged GLB;
they do not install Blender or obtain private reference images. Original concept
inputs remain private. The source recipe validates packed portable paths,
geometry, UVs, normals and linear vertex colors; numeric tests do not approve
appearance. See the study source README for rebuild commands and limitations.
The Gigi companion's separate editable source is under
`art/studies/gigi-hover-companion`. Neither study grants colony-family rollout
or replaces imported user figures. Full Outpost visual approval remains open.

Focused checks live in `tests/contract/test_mars_*.py`, the Mars unit tests,
`tests/unit/test_outpost_reference.py`, and frontend `components/society/mars`.
Keep functional, visual and operational acceptance separate. A successful
compile or technical export is not approval of the finished Outpost.
