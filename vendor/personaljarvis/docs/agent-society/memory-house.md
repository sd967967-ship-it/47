# The Memory House — one shared memory for every agent

Status: **binding for the memory wave, written 2026-09-02.** Subordinate to
[`MASTERPLAN.md`](MASTERPLAN.md) §2/§6 and [`agent-definition.md`](agent-definition.md) §5
(the Obsidian wiki is the society's shared memory). This document records the deep dive the
maintainer asked for, the decisions, and the checklist the build follows.

Maintainer's ask (2026-09-02): *"all agents share one memory system … analyze how it works today,
say how professionals would do it, make concrete proposals, build a spectacular modern Memory
House on the island, and when an agent uses the memory it walks there."*

---

## 1. How memory works today (the deep dive)

Jarvis itself has four memory layers; the society uses one of them, thinly.

| Layer | Where | Who writes | Who reads | Society agents today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core memory** (persona, user facts, ~1.5 k tokens, always in the prompt) | `data/core_memory.json` (`jarvis/memory/core_memory.py`) | the `remember` tool, the wizard | every brain call of Jarvis | not in their prompt; `remember` is a core tool they *can* call, which would write Jarvis' facts, not theirs |
| **Recall** (conversation log + awareness episodes, FTS5/BM25) | `data/jarvis.db` (`jarvis/memory/recall.py`) | the message recorder, awareness | `awareness-recall`, `awareness-snapshot` | Jarvis' episodes only; agent chats are not recorded there |
| **The wiki** (the long-term store: entities, concepts, projects, sessions; two-stage LLM curator; FTS5 index; a per-turn context injector with relevance gates) | `wiki/obsidian-vault/` (`jarvis/memory/wiki/*`, `jarvis/brain/wiki_context.py`) | the curator, `wiki-ingest`, the user in Obsidian | `wiki-recall`, `wiki-page-read`, `wiki-list`, the injector | **read**: the three tools when granted. **write**: only `society_wiki_note` into `society/<id>/` (a memory page + dated notes), with a `knowledge` staging row per write. `wiki-ingest` is denied |
| **Skills** (procedural memory) | `skills/`, `data/society/<id>/skills/` (`jarvis/society/learning.py`) | the learning pass | the briefing, `society_run_skill` | built in the last wave; private per agent, promotion as draft |

What is missing, found by reading the code, not the plan:

1. **No ambient memory.** `agent-definition.md` §3.3 step 6 promised "wiki context + the agent's
   memory page head" in every turn. Neither is wired: `society_system_extra` builds the briefing
   from roster + catalog + browser + skills and nothing else. An agent that wrote a memory
   yesterday does not see it today unless it thinks of searching.
2. **Agent notes are invisible to search.** `VaultIndex` loads only the typed directories
   (`entities/`, `concepts/`, …), and the FTS index skips nothing but `_archive`, but the pages
   `society_wiki_note` writes carry no `type:` frontmatter, so they are schema-invalid and the
   vault index drops them. `wiki-recall` therefore never returns another agent's note, and the
   "unreviewed marker" that §5 promises has no code behind it.
3. **No shared tier.** `society/shared/` exists on paper only. There is no promotion path, no
   curator action, no approval item "promote to shared knowledge"; `knowledge.reviewed` is never
   set by anything but a store method nobody calls.
4. **No provenance in retrieval.** The `knowledge` table records origin and taint, but no reader
   consults it: a web-origin note reads exactly like a user-written page.
5. **Nothing moves anyone.** `Checkpoint.ARCHIVE` exists in every layer, the walkers already
   walk to the `archive` place when a row says so, but no code ever derives a checkpoint
   (`world-behaviour-manual.md` §3 rule 6 is unimplemented). The roster column is `idle` forever.
6. **Two write shapes, one hidden.** A memory line lands in `memory.md`; a note lands as a page;
   both are recorded as staging rows; the board never sees a memory event, so the ledger and the
   HUD cannot show "Scout remembered X".

## 2. How the field does shared agent memory (what "professional" means here)

The patterns that have held up across MemGPT/Letta, LangGraph's memory store, Mem0, CrewAI's
shared memory and Anthropic's memory tool, reduced to what applies to a local single-user app:

| Principle | Meaning | Our reading |
|---|---|---|
| **One store of truth** | never two memories that can disagree | the vault stays the truth (agent-definition §5); every database row is derived and rebuildable |
| **Layers with different lifetimes** | working (this turn) · episodic (what happened) · semantic (what is true) · procedural (how to) | briefing head · dated notes · `memory.md` + `shared/` pages · learned skills |
| **Explicit scopes** | private · team · user; a reader always knows which | `society/<id>/` (own) · `society/shared/` (team, reviewed) · the rest of the vault (the user's) |
| **Provenance and trust travel with the fact** | origin, author, trace, reviewed state are part of the record and of every retrieval result | frontmatter + `knowledge` rows; the recall result prints `[unreviewed, web]` on the line |
| **A write gate, not a write ban** | agents write freely into their own scope; anything shared is reviewed | own scope free; `shared` = approval item; user pages never |
| **Retrieval is ranked, bounded and labelled** | relevance + recency + scope boost, a small k, and a frame that says "may be irrelevant" | the recall tool ranks own > shared > user > others' unreviewed; the briefing head is ≤ 1 200 chars |
| **Ambient + explicit** | a small always-on head plus a tool for deliberate lookups; never the whole memory in the prompt | "## Your memory" in the briefing + `society_memory_recall` |
| **Consolidate, do not accumulate** | dated notes are summarised into durable facts; duplicates supersede | the learning pass already writes one memory line per RESULT; the promote step copies, the dismiss step marks reviewed |
| **Every access is an event** | audit, UI, and — here — the world | a `DIGEST` envelope with `kind: memory` per read/write; the checkpoint engine reads it |
| **Quarantine untrusted text** | web-derived content never enters another agent's prompt ambiently | unreviewed web/agent pages are available on request only, never in the head |

## 3. The design — the Memory House system

**One rule:** the vault is the memory, the Memory House is its face, and every touch of memory
is an event that the island shows.

### 3.1 Layout in the vault (unchanged shape, now indexed)

```
society/
  <agent_id>/memory.md                 durable facts of this agent (semantic, own)
  <agent_id>/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md      work notes (episodic, own)
  shared/<slug>.md                     team knowledge (semantic, reviewed: true)
```
Every agent-written page carries `type: society`, `title`, `author: agent:<id>`, `origin`,
`trace`, `reviewed`, and shared pages add `promoted_from` and `promoted_ms`. `type: society`
makes them schema-valid for the vault index without touching the schema of the user's pages.

### 3.2 `jarvis/society/memory.py` — the one memory service

```
SocietyMemory(store, vault_root, on_activity)
  head(agent)                    -> str    the briefing section (memory.md head + shared titles)
  recall(agent, query, k=5)      -> hits   ranked: own > shared > user vault > others' unreviewed
  remember(agent, text, origin)  -> path   append to memory.md            (own, free)
  note(agent, title, text, …)    -> path   a dated page                   (own, free)
  propose_shared(agent, title, text) -> approval   a dated page + approval item core:memory:share
  promote(knowledge_id | path)   -> path   copy into shared/, reviewed: true, row reviewed
  dismiss(knowledge_id)          -> None   row reviewed without promotion (stays own)
  overview()                     -> dict   shared topics, per-agent heads, unreviewed queue
```
Ranking is deterministic and dependency-free (token overlap over title/body, a scope boost, a
recency tie-break); the user's vault pages come through `VaultSearch` when the FTS index is
available and are skipped quietly when it is not. Every call emits a `DIGEST` envelope
`{kind: "memory", op, path|query, hits, scope}` from the agent and calls `on_activity(agent_id)`.

### 3.3 Hands and prompt

- `society_memory_recall` (safe): the deliberate lookup. Result lines carry the scope and the
  trust marker: `[own]`, `[shared]`, `[user]`, `[unreviewed · web · scout]`.
- `society_wiki_note` keeps `note` and `memory` and gains `kind: shared` — a proposal that lands
  in the approvals queue as "promote to shared knowledge". Nothing an agent does writes into
  `shared/` directly.
- The briefing gains **`## Your memory`**: the first ≤ 1 200 characters of `memory.md`, the
  shared topic titles, and one line on how to use the two tools. Byte-stable between memory
  writes, so the provider cache stays warm.

### 3.4 The world reads memory — the checkpoint engine

`jarvis/society/checkpoints.py`, trusted Python, pure rules over facts the runtime already has
(the vocabulary that exists in every layer today — `desk | meeting | archive | gate | idle`):

1. `state == paused` → `idle`
2. an open approval for the agent → `gate`
3. member of a running room → `meeting`
4. memory activity within the last **60 s** (hold: the house stands at the north end, the walk from the square takes most of a minute) → `archive`
5. a run is in flight for the agent → `desk`
6. otherwise → `idle`

The runtime persists a change through `roster.update`, publishes `SocietyCheckpointChanged`
on the app bus (the WebSocket forwards every bus event), and the World stage invalidates its
roster query on that event — the figure walks within a second, and the ledger shows the same row.
A timer re-evaluates when the hold expires. The `hub:*` superset of the behaviour manual is
unchanged and lands with the five-layer change it needs.

### 3.5 The Memory House on the island

- Replaces the primitive Archive tower on the archive plot at the island's north end (behind
  the Jarvis Hub, on the axis, reached by the archive road that goes round the hub);
  the `archive` place keeps its id, so the walkers, the labels and the checkpoint enum need no
  new value.
- Built by `scripts/world/kit_memory_house.py` on the helpers of `build_world_kit.py` (the Blender
  MCP drives the inner loop; the committed script is the truth; ~4 600 triangles, 8 × 6 tiles): a dark plinth with a glowing reflecting ring,
  a translucent glass monolith with a luminous core sphere and stacked "memory layers" inside, a
  cantilevered roof slab with a light edge, a tilted halo ring with light nodes, two data pylons
  and a floating MEMORY sign.
- Faces (behaviour manual §6): **agent** — stand point in front of the door, `work` clip while
  there; **viewer** — click opens the Memory drawer: shared topics, each agent's memory head, the
  unreviewed queue with *Promote* / *Mark reviewed*, a recall search box, a link to the Wiki
  section; **live signal** — the core and the halo nodes brighten while an agent stands at the
  house (derived on the client from the roster's checkpoints — no second truth).

### 3.6 Safety (unchanged chokepoint)

Agents write only under `society/<own id>/`; `shared/` is written by the promote action only, from
the approvals route; user pages are never edited (path containment in the service). Web- and
agent-origin pages are never in any agent's ambient head. Keys never enter memory (AP-2/AP-12):
the service refuses a `remember`/`note` body that matches the secret guard patterns.

## 4. Checklist

| # | Item | Where | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 ✅ | `SocietyMemory` service: head, recall, remember, note, propose_shared, promote, dismiss, overview; `DIGEST kind=memory` per op; `type: society` frontmatter; secret guard | `jarvis/society/memory.py` | `tests/unit/society/test_memory.py` green |
| 2 ✅ | Tools: `society_memory_recall`; `society_wiki_note` delegates to the service and accepts `kind: shared` | `agent_tools.py`, `surface.py` | tool tests green, briefing shows `## Your memory` |
| 3 ✅ | Checkpoint engine + `SocietyCheckpointChanged` + runtime hooks (run start/end, memory activity, approval enqueue/resolve, room open/settle) | `checkpoints.py`, `runtime.py`, `jarvis/core/events.py` | `test_checkpoints.py` green; the roster row flips to `archive` after a memory op |
| 4 ✅ | REST: `GET /api/society/memory`, `POST /api/society/memory/recall`, `POST /api/society/memory/{id}/promote`, `POST …/dismiss`; approvals resolve promotes `core:memory:share` items | `society_routes.py` | route tests green; CLI coverage gate green |
| 5 ✅ | Blender: `build_memory_house()`; GLB exported; preview checked through the MCP | `scripts/world/kit_memory_house.py`, `assets/society/world/kit/memory-house.glb` | GLB in the tree (4 584 triangles: the glass, the core and the halo cost more than a hall; trimmed bevels keep it near the other hubs) |
| 6 ✅ | Island: the Memory House stands on the archive plot, old tower removed, footprint blocks walking, label renamed in three locales | `MemoryHouse.tsx`, `Landmarks.tsx`, `islandLayout.ts`, `PlaceLabels.tsx`, locales | `islandLayout.test.ts` green |
| 7 ✅ | Memory drawer + live core signal + WS invalidation on `SocietyCheckpointChanged` | `MemoryDrawer.tsx`, `MemoryHouse.tsx`, `WorldStage.tsx`, `useWebSocket.ts` | drawer opens on click; core glows when an agent is at the house |
| 8 ✅ | Docs: this file, `jarvis/society/README.md`, `world-behaviour-manual.md` §3 note, `agent-definition.md` §5 pointer | docs | privacy review of touched docs |
| 9 | Bundle rebuilt (`npm run build`), commits per wave by pathspec, no push | — | the running app shows the house after its self-reload |

## 5. Tests

- `test_memory.py`: frontmatter is schema-valid; recall ranks own before shared before others;
  unreviewed web notes carry the marker and never appear in `head()`; `propose_shared` queues an
  approval and writes nothing under `shared/`; `promote` copies with `reviewed: true` and marks
  the row; secrets are refused; every op appends one `DIGEST` with `kind: memory`.
- `test_checkpoints.py`: rule order, the memory hold, the timer re-evaluation.
- `test_society_routes.py`: overview, recall, promote via the approvals route.
- `islandLayout.test.ts`: the archive road arrives at the stand, stand reachable, footprint blocked.

## 6. Risks and the honest edges

- The user's vault FTS index is refreshed by the wiki watcher; a note written a second ago may not
  be found through `VaultSearch` yet. The service's own scan of `society/` is always current.
- The world reads the roster; a window that lost its WebSocket falls back to the 30 s poll and
  still ends up with the right place, just later.
- The Memory House is the first building whose live signal depends on other agents' rows; it is
  derived client-side from the same roster the walkers use, so it can never disagree with them.
