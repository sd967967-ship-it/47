# World Art Direction — the island

> Art-production workflow amendment (2026-09-08): follow
> [Game-art production standard](game-art-pipeline.md) for future asset/design work.
> It governs reference-scene approval and rollout; this document's current runtime
> contracts remain intact. Its historical art choices are not approval of a new redesign.

Status: **binding for M3 (world), decided with the maintainer on 2026-09-01/02.**
Subordinate to [`MASTERPLAN.md`](MASTERPLAN.md) §4.1/§4.3; this is the art-direction pass the
master plan requires before environment assets are built. Figures are governed by
[`character-pipeline.md`](character-pipeline.md). Code: `jarvis/ui/web/frontend/src/components/society/world/`
(model in `islandLayout.ts`, colours in `worldPalette.ts`).

## 1. The picture in one paragraph

A bright pixel island in the warm light of a late afternoon — the softness and colour of a
cosy farming game rendered in true 3D — on which a small **solarpunk village** stands: white walls,
glass bands, solar barrel roofs, garden roofs, wood accents, rounded shapes. The town is laid out
like a real one: ONE open square in the middle where everyone gathers, streets and narrower alleys
around it, rectangular blocks of terraced houses between them, a boulevard closing the town, and
the biggest house — the lead's hub — at the head of the avenue. Around the town, four quarters carry
the working places of the society. Seen steeply from above, lightly pixelated, never dark, never monochrome.

## 2. Decisions (maintainer, 2026-09-01/02)

| # | Question | Decision | Why it beat the runner-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Look | **Colourful pixel island** (cosy-farming-game softness in 3D) | matches "bright, beautiful, lightly pixelated"; a block diorama or clean low-poly would lose the warmth |
| 2 | Camera | **Steep bird's-eye: 50° below the horizon, 45° dimetric yaw**, orthographic | reads as "from above" yet keeps house fronts and figure silhouettes; 30–35° gives more façade but less overview |
| 3 | Size | **16 × 16 fields (512 m); the central 4 × 4 fields are the market district** | the maintainer wants a big island that is not seen in one screen — grown from 10 × 10 on 2026-09-02 ("at least 50 % bigger"); one field = one screen at the closest zoom |
| 4 | Landscape | **A village / small town** on an island of **biomes at different heights**: a snow-capped mountain, terraced hills, alpine meadows, a rocky cape, a tropical cove with a lagoon, the harbor bay, orchards, a dark forest | free-text decisions: "a village, ultramodern, future-oriented" (2026-09-01) and "not flat — biomes, heights, spectacular, never overloaded" (2026-09-02) |
| 5 | Architecture | **Solarpunk village** — white + glass + solar + gardens + wood, lots of green between | colourful AND futuristic; pure factory grey or neon-cyber contradicts the bright island |
| 6 | Centre | **A block town, not a ring** (revised 2026-09-02): the open square in the middle, a street framing it, a grid of streets and alleys with rectangular blocks of terraced houses between them, a boulevard with rounded corners closing the town, the lead's hub at the head of the north avenue | the maintainer's sketch of 2026-09-02: "like a real city — blocks, streets and alleys, centred, everything facing the viewer"; the comic-village ring (2026-09-01) looked arranged, not lived in |
| 7 | Pixel grain | **Fine — 2 screen pixels per rendered pixel** (a 1280-px stage renders at 640 px) | figures and signs stay readable; 320×180 would be too coarse for a big island |
| 8 | Navigation | **Drag + arrow keys/WASD, five fixed zoom steps (32 / 64 / 128 / 256 / 512 m), minimap with relief** | 256 fields need zoom to find an agent; fixed steps keep pixels crisp; the widest step is the postcard of the island |

Decided by the build, open to the maintainer: fixed warm-afternoon light in V1 (a real-clock
day/night cycle is a later flavour); animated pixel water; the hub carries the pulsing beacon
that will map onto the voice orb.

## 3. Layout

Units: 1 world unit = 1 m; one tile = 2 m; the island is 256 × 256 tiles (512 m). World origin
is the island centre; +x east, +z south. The camera looks toward the north-west, so the tall
things stand at the back (north-west) and the low, bright things in the foreground (south-east).

```

   solar terrace            |

```

**Biomes, as tile kinds:** sand · grass · meadow · forest · alpine · heath (heather drifts over
the high moor) · dry (savanna on the eastern lowland) · farm (crop rows, south-west) · marsh
(pools and reeds on the south-western coast) · scree (gravel on the mountain's flanks) · rock ·
snow · quarry (the mine's forecourt). Plain grass is kept to the village plateau and the
lowland around it; everything further out belongs to a named biome.

**Terrain:** a continuous height field (`islandLayout.heightAt`) — a radial fall-off plus one
designed bump or dip per biome (`REGIONS`) plus a little noise — quantised into ten levels
(`LEVEL_Y`, 0.35 m at the beach to 12.6 m at the peak). Every slope becomes a terrace, every
steep place a cliff. The tile kind follows level and region: sand → grass / meadow → forest (west)
→ alpine (high, north-east and the mountain) → rock → snow (level 8+). Flower fields are drifts of
`garden` tiles over the meadows. Offshore: four rock islets with a green crown, the breakwater in
the bay's mouth, the lagoon (sea level, enclosed by a sandbar, a channel to the sea, a jetty).

**Roads are graded:** each spoke is walked outward from the square and clamped to ±1 level per
tile, shoulders included, so a walker can climb to the archive hill or the cape; cliffs of two
steps or more are real barriers (`findPath` refuses them). Every place's plot is flattened to its
own terrace level (`PLOT_LEVEL`): the archive on the hill at 5, the lighthouse knob at 6, the
harbor and the gardens low at 2, the solar field on the mountain's foot terrace at 4.

**Market district — the town (a rounded-square plateau, `squareDist` ≤ 37 tiles, level 3):**
- the plan (`TOWN`, `townZone`), in tile offsets from the centre on both axes: the square
  (|k| ≤ 11, paved, garden beds in runs along its rim), the frame street (12–14), the inner
  blocks (15–23), the middle street (24–26), the outer blocks (27–30), the boulevard (31–33,
  drawn in the 4-norm so its corners are rounded), a green fringe to the plateau's edge;
- two avenues (|k| ≤ 1) leave the square on both axes and run on as the spokes; two alleys per
  axis (13–14, 2 wide) continue the frame street's outer edge and cut the bands into blocks;
- the Quest Board monument in the exact centre, a ring bench around it, the long table on the
  south side — this is the `meeting` checkpoint (MASTERPLAN §2.7);
- **twenty blocks** (`BLOCK_TEMPLATES` × four quadrants, `townBlocks`): five templates per
  quadrant — inner N/S beside the avenue, the inner corner, inner E/W beside the avenue, outer
  N/S, outer E/W; the outer corner slivers the boulevard cuts off are parks;
- **which way a house faces** (maintainer 2026-09-02): a block's FRONT sides are its south and
  east edges — the sides the camera sees (`CAMERA_FROM`, from the south-east). Houses stand in
  a terraced row along the south front (doors on the street south of the block) and in a column
  up the east front (doors on the street east of it); the north row and the west column are
  hedged back gardens. So every door faces the viewer and no house ever shows its back. Forty
  houses (`townHouses`, 6.8 × 4.8 m on 4 × 3-tile lots), three variants cycling: solar-barrel
  roof, garden roof, glass loft;
- the four halls take four blocks (`KIT_BLOCKS`): Plugin Docks and Skill Forge north of the
  square flanking the avenue, the Relay Tower on the north-east corner block, the Terminal
  Cantina west of the square — every hall one street from the square, door on the street;
- **the viewer may turn any house or hall** (`buildingPoses.ts`, `RotateHandle.tsx`): click a
  house (or open a hub's drawer) and a knob appears on the front of its selection ring; drag the
  knob around the building and it follows, Shift snaps to 15° steps, and close to the designed
  heading it snaps back. The badge beside the knob shows the heading and, once turned, a Reset;
  the HUD offers "reset all". Headings are per viewer (localStorage), never synced, and go
  straight into the island model (`applyBuildingYaws`): the blocked tiles, a hub's stand tile
  and facing all move with the building, and walkers mid-route re-plan;
- **nothing walks through furniture:** houses and hubs block their footprints plus a 0.5 m wall
  margin; the monument's plinth and ring bench block 6 m around the centre and the long table
  its rectangle; the hub's wings, colonnade, planters, pool and flag masts, the harbor kiosk and
  gate pillars, the keeper's hut, every lamp post and every hedge segment block their tiles
  (`blockSquareFurniture`, `blockLandmarkFurniture`, `buildIsland`). A figure that finds a
  building turned over its head steps to the nearest free tile first (`nearestWalkable`);
- the **hub** (lead agent) beyond the boulevard at the head of the north avenue, closing its
  vista, on a **podium one level up** (18 × 8 tiles) with a paved forecourt down to the
  boulevard: a 24 × 12 m hall with a glass band and garden roofs, a set-back upper floor, the
  glass atrium under the dome, the beacon spire with its halo, two solar-roofed wings, a
  colonnade over the entrance, the grand stair down to the forecourt, the reflecting pool and
  two flag masts at its foot;
- three spokes (width 3 tiles) from the boulevard to the quarters south, west and east; north
  the **archive road** (`NORTH_ROAD`) leaves the boulevard on the eastern alley's line, passes
  the hub's podium, turns west behind it and climbs the hill onto the archive's axis — the hub
  closes the avenue, so the way to the Memory House goes round it and nothing stands on it
  (maintainer 2026-09-02); the mine's branch leaves its last leg;
- lamps on the outer rows of the frame street, the middle street and the boulevard's straight
  runs, never in a street mouth; hedges (`placeStreetFurniture`) close every block's back sides.

**Quarters and checkpoints** (backend place → island place, `Walkers.tsx`):

| checkpoint | place | building |
|---|---|---|
| `desk` | workshop (west, a clearing in the forest) | long hall, sawtooth skylights, wide door toward the village |
| `meeting` | market square | the table under the big tree |
| `archive` | archive (north, on the terraced hill) | round tower, two glass bands, blue dome |
| `gate` | harbor gate (south, the bay) | gate pillars over the dock into the bay, kiosk, two moored boats, buoys, breakwater |
| — | lighthouse (east cape, on the rock) | striped tower with rotating lamp, keeper's hut |
| — | gardens (south-east, the cove's low terrace) | six glass greenhouses on garden tiles |
| — | solar field (north-west, the mountain's foot terrace) | 35 tilted panels on posts |
| — | the mine (the mountain's south-eastern flank, off the north road) | timber portal in a cliff, lanterns, rails, ore cart, headframe, foreman's hut |

Idle agents (`idle`) wander inside the square with the rest-biased model (`wander.ts`);
paused agents stand still.

**Light and life:** lamps along the town's streets and the boulevard, the spokes, the archive
road, the dock and the mine's road — every lamp throws an additive pool of light on the ground; festoon
strings over the square from eight poles; the lighthouse's two sweeping beams; lanterns on the
mine's portal; a campfire on the cove's beach; lights on the buoys; the hub's halo beacon.

**Sea:** a subdivided plane with real waves — three swells plus breakers that build as the
bottom rises (from the shore-distance field), lit by the sun with a glint, whitecaps on the
crests, a breathing foam line, and a wash sheet that runs up the beach and drains back.

**Vegetation per biome** (`treeChoice`): round trees on grass and meadow (dense and taller in the
forest), pines on the alpine meadows and the high slopes, palms on the cove's sand — thickest
around the lagoon; boulders on the high ground, at the foot of cliffs and on the beaches.

## 4. Palette

Everything inside the viewport comes from `worldPalette.ts`. Never a theme token, never Ink &
Paper, never the Cursor design doc (MASTERPLAN §4.3). Two shades per terrain kind give the
tile-art flicker under the pixel pass.

| Role | Colours |
|---|---|
| sky / clear | `#a5dbff` |
| sea | shallow `#72d3e2`, surface `#44a0dd`, deep `#2f7fc4`, abyss `#1e5c9a`, ripple `#9fdcf6`, foam `#e4f6ff` |
| sand | `#f3e2ad` / `#ead597` |
| grass | `#7ccb5c` / `#6fbe51`; meadow (high ground) `#97d46c` / `#8ac860` |
| forest floor | `#4f9e47` / `#47923f`; alpine `#bcd97c` / `#aecf6f`; snow `#f6f9fc` / `#e9eff6` |
| rock | `#a8a7b3` / `#9a99a6`, faces `#6f6e7c` |
| square / paths | `#ece1cf` / `#e2d5c0`; paths `#dcc9a5` / `#d0bd97` |
| cliff faces under grass | `#8e6a44` |
| walls | `#f7f3ea` / `#e6e0d2`, trim `#c9c2b2` |
| glass | `#8ed2f0` (unlit — it glows) |
| solar | `#26375a`, seams `#3e5f95` |
| wood | `#b57f45` / `#8c5e2f`, doors `#e0893b` |
| lead accent | `#2f6f8f` (the Jarvis palette of the roster), beacon `#ffe08a` |
| trees | trunk `#7a5230`, canopies `#4faf49` / `#6cc35e` / `#93da7c`; pines `#2f7f45` / `#3b9452` / `#5aae64`; palms `#4fb254` / `#7ccf6c`; boulders `#a19fab` / `#7e7c8a` |
| in-world type | Pixelify Sans (OFL, bundled via fontsource), ink `#1f2a3a` on cream chips |

Light: hemisphere sky `#d6ecff` / ground `#7f9c5a`, one warm directional sun `#fff1d6` from the
south-west, **no tone mapping** (`flat`), no shadows (a 2-px shadow is noise; a blob decal under
the feet comes with the figure pipeline). Materials: Lambert for lit surfaces, Basic for glass,
lamps and beacons — never PBR.

## 5. Rendering rules

- Orthographic camera, `RenderPixelatedPass` (normal edge 0.18, depth edge 0.28) +
  `OutputPass`, `dpr = 1`, antialias off. Pixel size is an integer (2); zoom never scales the
  pixel grid.
- Terrain is ONE merged vertex-coloured mesh (high ground tinted lighter, wet sand darker); trees,
  pines, palms, boulders, hedges, lamps, panels and greenhouses are instanced; the sea is one
  plane whose shader reads a shore-distance texture (depth tint, crests rolling in, foam line); buildings are shared unit geometries scaled per use, sharing ~25 materials through
  `WorldKit`.
- Every canvas mounts through `useWebglSurface`; the loop pauses via IntersectionObserver;
  reduced motion → demand-driven frames, no wander, no water drift; no WebGL → fallback to the
  Ledger.
- DOM over the canvas (nameplates, place signs, HUD) is legible at every zoom because it is not
  pixelated; it uses the world's type and colours.

## 6. What V1 ships, what comes next

V1 (this pass): terrain + sea, the market village, the four quarters' landmarks, trees,
navigation (drag / keys / 3 zoom steps / minimap), stand-in walkers with wander + checkpoints +
nameplates + click-to-select, place signs, the World / Ledger switch in the Jarvis Agents section.

Next, in order: the model card opening on a figure click (the card session's overlay); real
figures from the character pipeline replacing `WalkerFigure` (F3); speech bubbles and the
choreography queue on the society event stream (MASTERPLAN §3.3); the "Active now" face strip
and today's cost in the HUD; a day/night flavour; the headless-Chrome screenshot check.
