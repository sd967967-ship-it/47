# AP-23 Audit Wave 2 — proactive fresh-machine defect scan (2026-07-07)

Follow-up to `fresh-machine-forensics-2026-07.md` (whose findings are all
excluded here as known). Four parallel read-only scans over the whole codebase,
one per defect pattern: config gates/placeholders, external binaries/optional
imports, platform/hardware calibration, expected-but-unshipped files. Goal:
find every REMAINING "works only on the maintainer's machine" defect before
the Level-3 release gate is built. No fixes in this document.

Overall: the platform/paths surface is unusually clean (pathlib everywhere,
UTF-8 file I/O, lazy optional imports, honest platform no-ops). The real
findings cluster in four roots below.

## P1 — bricks a core path on a fresh machine

1. **Missions hard-depend on the `git` binary, unguarded.**
   `jarvis/missions/isolation/worktree.py:677` (`_run_git`) and `:638`
   (`_run_git_in`) catch only `CalledProcessError`; a missing git binary
   raises `FileNotFoundError`, which escapes `WorktreeManager.create()` and
   the orchestrator handler (`kontrollierer/orchestrator.py:1037` catches only
   `CalledProcessError, ValueError`). Every mission crashes raw — even for
   pure in-process API workers that need no external binary, because
   `orchestrator.py:1032` wraps every task in a worktree. No git preflight
   exists (doctor.py doesn't report git). Fix shape: preflight git at mission
   dispatch + catch `FileNotFoundError/OSError` → honest "Jarvis-Agents need
   git installed" failure.
   - Facet: ZIP/"Download ZIP" installs (no `.git`) → `git worktree add`
     exits 128 → generic `SETUP_FAILED` with no user-visible reason
     (worktree.py:232-242 → orchestrator.py:1037-1039). Distinguish
     "not a git repository" → actionable message.

2. **`python-ulid` is an undeclared runtime dependency** — present on the
   maintainer's box only via a manual editable `OS-Level` install.
   Chain: `control/keyboard.py:16/28/40` + `control/mouse.py:56/105/124`
   (@overlay_action_sync) → `overlay/triggers.py:146` `_get_bridge()`
   (UNGUARDED) → `overlay/integration.py:32` → `overlay/bridge.py:25` →
   `overlay/schema.py:29` → `OS-Level/src/overlay/schema.py:28`
   `from ulid import ULID`. Declared only in
   `OS-Level/src/overlay.egg-info/requires.txt`, not in `pyproject.toml` /
   `requirements.txt`; the installer never installs `OS-Level`.
   Consequences on every fresh clone: keyboard/mouse tool actions raise
   `ModuleNotFoundError: ulid`; the Orb/mascot + virtual cursor silently
   never start (`ui/web/launcher.py:635` misreads it as "headless";
   `ui/desktop_app.py:1537-1546` only handles `exc.name=="overlay"`).
   Fix shape: add `python-ulid>=2.2` to base deps (regenerate the lockfile
   with `uv pip compile --universal`) AND guard `_get_bridge()` to a NoOp
   bridge on `ModuleNotFoundError` (honest degrade if anything else is off).

## Security-critical (shipped predictable credentials)

3. **`docker-compose.yml:21` ships a functional, world-known Control-API
   key** (`jctl_local_sandbox_change_me_before_any_real_use`) as the real
   runtime value on the documented VPS path; the container binds 0.0.0.0 and
   only the host port mapping keeps it loopback. Any published/proxied port 8000
   leaves config writes, mission dispatch and shell behind a public constant.
   Fix shape: the app refuses (or regenerates) when the control key equals the
   shipped literal; compose uses `${JARVIS_CONTROL_API_KEY:?}` with no default.

4. **Predictable webhook token on a shell-exec path, self-healing against
   deletion.** `conductor/seed/webhook_demo.yaml:18`
   (`demo_token_change_me_in_production_1234`, `enabled: true` line 10)
   passes the min-length guard (`conductor/api/routes.py:99-103`), is
   re-seeded every boot (`conductor/core/seed.py:59-62`), and
   `POST /api/conductor/hooks/{token}` is public-by-design
   (`routes.py:185-201`, mounted at `server.py:336`). Blast radius today is a
   harmless echo step, but it is a shipped known credential on a shell-exec
   route. Fix shape: seed `enabled: false` + force-regenerate any token equal
   to the shipped literal.

## P2 — dishonest or wrong behavior

5. **`dispatch-with-review` router tool dies with a raw KeyError naming the
   removed `openclaw` harness** (install-wide, latent):
   `brain/factory.py:69` keeps it in ROUTER_TOOLS; bare `cls()` instantiation
   (`factory.py:455`) → spawners default `harness_name="openclaw"`
   (`core/review/spawns.py:116/:194`) → `KeyError` at `harness/manager.py:68`.
   Fix shape: resolve a registered harness or return an honest
   "review gate unavailable" ToolResult (ADR-0011: keep the tool in the set).

6. **Wheel installs brick at first SQLite open — package-data gaps.**
   `pyproject.toml [tool.setuptools.package-data]` covers only ui/web/dist,
   assets, plugins/tool/*.mjs. Missing: `*/schema.sql` (board/memory/missions/
   sessions/tasks/workflows — `sessions/store.py:64` read_text has no guard),
   `brain/JARVIS_PERSONA.md`, seed catalogs, `memory/migrations/*.sql`,
   wiki templates, `skills/builtin/**/SKILL.md`,
   `core/review/verdict_schema.json`, `skills/safe_imports.txt`. Masked today
   only because installs are editable. Fix shape: extend package-data globs.

7. **`_run_git` lacks `encoding="utf-8"`** (its sibling `_run_git_at:638-646`
   has it): non-cp1252 branch/file names → UnicodeDecodeError on Windows
   (worktree.py:677-684). Same fix-package as finding 1.

8. **`platform/window_state.py:290-296, 326-332`** (osascript & friends)
   parse window titles with `text=True` and no encoding → UnicodeDecodeError
   on non-UTF-8 locales instead of "no match". Fix shape: pin
   `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` on human-text subprocess parses.

9. **Custom-wake match gate uses absolute RMS floors** calibrated on the
   maintainer's mic (`speech/rolling_whisper_wake.py:112-132,271` —
   `_MATCH_MIN_SPEECH_RMS=0.006`, `min_rms=0.003`, `min_peak=0.008`): quiet
   laptop mics (real speech 0.003-0.006) get custom-wake matches silently
   dropped. CAUTION AP-27: these floors are the ghost discriminator — never
   simply lower them; the fix is per-session noise-floor-relative calibration,
   same approach as the known mic-meter follow-up. Handle deliberately, not in
   the quick wave.

10. **MCP stdio spawn error lacks an actionable hint**: `mcp/client.py:96-103`
    doesn't which()-check `npx`/node; a missing Node surfaces as a raw
    `FileNotFoundError` string on the plugin badge (caught at
    `mcp/registry.py:187`). Fix shape: map to "install Node.js 18+".

## P3 — wrong-for-everyone or latent (honest degrade)

11. **"Call X" voice tool can never dial** (dead for ALL installs, honest
    no-op): `plugins/tool/call_contact.py:81` reads `loaded.telephony` (field
    doesn't exist; Twilio lives at `integrations.twilio`, config.py:1398) and
    `:85` reads `from_number` (field is `phone_number`, config.py:1350).
    Fix shape: read the real attributes.
12. **`recommend_whisper` gates GPU advice on `torch.cuda.is_available()`**
    (`hardware/detection.py:162,244`) though the engine is CTranslate2 and
    torch is absent from base → NVIDIA boxes without torch always get "no
    GPU"; with torch it recommends on presence (AP-25). Degrades safe.
13. **In-app feedback dead-ends every downloader**: `feedback_routes.py:131-141`
    requires a maintainer-only Discord webhook secret; users are told to set a
    credential that is meaningless for them. Fix shape: fall back to the
    public GitHub issues URL / reword.
14. **PyInstaller spec doesn't bundle in-package data** (`jarvis.spec:46` only
    top-level assets; no `collect_data_files("jarvis")`; `:60` still collects
    removed chromadb/sentence_transformers).
15. **`PROJECT_ROOT = parents[2]` anchors data/.env to the source checkout**
    (`core/config.py:51` + ~10 sites): wheel installs would write into
    site-packages. Larger refactor (platformdirs) — defer to a dedicated task.

## Verified-clean surfaces (for confidence, no findings)

Optional-extra imports uniformly lazy/guarded; node-CLI/ffmpeg/MCP-install/
OAuth-bot paths which()-check and degrade honestly; no hardcoded absolute
paths in runtime code; file I/O is UTF-8 throughout; STT main path has
cuda→cpu construction fallback; data/ dirs are mkdir-on-demand; persona/terms
readers degrade cleanly; awareness/self-mod/board/vision tools degrade
honestly; get_secret sites in web routes are guarded.

## Disposition

Quick wave (low-risk honest fixes): findings 1+7 (one package), 2, 3, 4, 5,
11, and the mechanical bundle 6+8+10+13. Deliberate follow-ups: 9 (AP-27
calibration design), 12, 14, 15. All feed the Level-3 release gate, whose
Linux job must install BASE (see the evdev note in the forensics doc).

## Status — quick wave LANDED + verified 2026-07-07

All quick-wave findings fixed, each TDD + independently reviewed clean; final
sweep 1676 tests pass, both dependency guards green. Commits (shared tree —
some landed under auto-save messages, content verified):

- Finding 3 (control-API placeholder key → treated as unset; boot refuses on a
  non-loopback bind): `87fbd928`.
- Finding 4 (demo webhook `enabled:false` + force-regenerate the predictable
  token on every seed/re-seed): `49e0d2f3`.
- Findings 1(dep)+2 (python-ulid declared in base + lockfile; honest NoOp
  overlay guard; launcher/desktop misclassification fixed) — controller-verified
  on a real `python:3.11-slim` container (base install + `import ulid` +
  triggers import PASS).
- Findings 1(git)+7 (honest SETUP_FAILED when git binary/`.git` is missing;
  UTF-8 git decode; es phrases): `7bcebcfa`, `e57202b9`.
- Finding 5 (dispatch-with-review resolves a real harness or degrades honestly;
  never leaks "openclaw"): `5b106ca0`.
- Findings 11+13 (call-contact reads real Twilio config + honors the `enabled`
  switch; in-app feedback points downloaders at GitHub issues): `4e323f81`,
  `25ac8782`.
- Findings 6+8+10 (wheel package-data for all runtime files; window_state
  UTF-8 decode; actionable MCP node-missing hint): `400ad4bb`.

Deferred follow-ups remain open (12, 14, 15) plus two cosmetic tidies (the
dispatch-with-review tool description still says "OpenClaw" → rename per
CLAUDE.md §4; two pre-existing German strings in `mcp/client.py`). No push —
these are local commits pending the maintainer's explicit publish.

Finding 9 LANDED 2026-07-09 (pre-launch wave): session-relative noise-floor
calibration of the wake energy gates, lower-only —
`SessionNoiseFloor` in `jarvis/speech/rolling_whisper_wake.py` scales
`min_rms`/`min_peak`/`match_min_rms` down toward `K x floor` on a quiet mic
while capping every effective gate at its legacy absolute (maintainer-mic
behavior bit-identical; AP-27 discriminator preserved by construction:
ghosts sit AT the floor, the match gate at 1.4x the floor). The mic-meter
part of Bug 17 landed in the same wave (`jarvis/audio/mic_level.py`:
`_MIN_NOISE_FLOOR` 0.001→0.0002, `_MIN_PEAK` 0.01→0.004, auto-gain
reference starts at the floor). Guards:
`tests/unit/speech/test_rolling_whisper_wake_noise_floor_calibration.py`,
`tests/unit/audio/test_mic_level.py` (quiet-laptop + muted-mic pins).
