# ADR-0011 — Main Jarvis is a Pure Dispatcher with EXACTLY four tools

**Status:** Amended 2026-07-13
**Phase:** Persona refactor §3 — routing fix

## Context

The probe-drift inventory (`docs/persona-research.md` section 1) showed that 6 of 10 smalltalk inputs to `voice_e2e_probe` produced empty outputs — the main-Jarvis brain (Grok-4.1-fast or Gemini-2.5-flash as the router tier) reflexively issued `spawn_sub_jarvis` as a tool call. Cause: ROUTER_TOOLS in `factory.py` contained **eleven** tools (open-app, type-text, run-shell, search-web, screen-snapshot, remember, whoami, multi-spawn, spawn-sub-jarvis, plus hotkey/click from earlier work), while the ROUTER system prompt (`router.py:9`) explicitly promised only **four** (`run_shell`, `screenshot`, `multi_spawn`, `spawn_sub_jarvis`).

That was the source of the drift:
- The LLM had too many direct-action options.
- The ROUTER prompt commanded "when in doubt, SPAWN" — so the brain chose the spawn reflex even for trivial smalltalk.
- The force-spawn heuristic (`_FORCE_SPAWN_RE`) covered only repair verbs (`umsetz`/`reparier`/`fix`/`implementier`/`refactor`/`debug`) — **not** `lies`, `baue`, `installiere`, `öffne`, `mach`, `zeig`.

Master plan §22 specifies: four router tools (`screen_snapshot`, `multi_spawn`, `spawn_sub_jarvis` + the existing `run_shell`). The code reality (11 tools) contradicts the spec.

## Decision

**Main Jarvis = Pure Dispatcher.** Reduce ROUTER_TOOLS to exactly four, load the deterministic force-spawn heuristic from config, and add a ROUTER-DISCIPLINE prompt section.

### 1. ROUTER_TOOLS reduction

```python
# jarvis/brain/factory.py
ROUTER_TOOLS = frozenset({
    "run-shell",
    "screen-snapshot",
    "multi-spawn",
    "spawn-sub-jarvis",
})
```

Direct actions outside these four (`open_app`, `type_text`, `search_web`, `remember`, `whoami`) belong in the Jarvis-Agent tier — the router delegates them via `spawn_sub_jarvis`.

### 2. Deterministic force-spawn heuristic

`BrainManager._should_force_sub_jarvis(text)` runs in `generate()` BEFORE the LLM tool-use loop. Three regex patterns from `BrainRoutingConfig`:

- `spawn_verbs`: 30+ action verbs (DE+EN). Match → spawn (except the smalltalk allowlist).
- `external_system_markers`: `pr`/`prs`/`issue`/`repo`/`github`/`gitlab`/`branch`. Match → spawn (except the smalltalk allowlist).
- `smalltalk_allowlist`: Wins over verb/marker. `hallo`/`danke`/`wie geht`/`hauptstadt`/etc. → NEVER spawn.

Configurable via `[brain.routing]` in `jarvis.toml`; defaults from `BrainRoutingConfig` (Pydantic).

### 3. ROUTER-DISCIPLINE prompt

Directly after SCREEN-CONTEXT in `router.py:SYSTEM_PROMPT`:

```
ROUTER DISCIPLINE (Haiku-Tier — Persona-Mandat Phase 3)
Du bist der Dispatcher. Du planst nicht, paraphrasierst nicht, zerlegst nicht.
- Bei Smalltalk, einfachen Fakten oder allem in 1-2 Saetzen Beantwortbaren:
  antworte DIREKT ohne Tool-Call.
- Bei allem, was Datei-Zugriff, Code-Ausfuehrung, Computer-Use, Multi-Step-Planung
  oder externe Recherche erfordert: rufe spawn_sub_jarvis mit der User-Utterance
  VERBATIM auf (nicht zusammenfassen, nicht umformulieren).
SPAWN-CRITERIA — rufe spawn_sub_jarvis auf, WENN:
  • Verb deutet auf Datei-/Code-/System-Aktion
  • Request erwaehnt eine Datei, ein Projekt oder ein externes System
  • Multi-Step-Anweisung
  • Recherche, Analyse, Vergleich
DO-NOT-SPAWN — antworte direkt, WENN:
  • Greeting, Smalltalk, Faktenfrage aus dem Gedaechtnis
  • Klarfrage an den User
  • Status-Bestaetigung
```

### 4. D9 recursion guard (unchanged, now explicitly tested)

`spawn-sub-jarvis` must NEVER land in `SUB_TOOLS` — a Jarvis-Agent cannot recursively spawn new Jarvis-Agent instances. Master plan §6 D9. Test: `test_spawn_sub_jarvis_only_in_router_tools`.

## Consequences

+ **Smalltalk latency back under 1 s first token.** 5 smalltalk turns spawn 0 subprocesses (deterministically verified by tests: `test_smalltalk_dispatches_zero_spawn_calls` × 5).
+ **Spawn behavior is configurable.** The user can adjust the verb list, markers, and allowlist in `jarvis.toml` without a code edit.
+ **Code matches master plan §22.** Router tool set 1:1 as specified.
+ **Master-plan conflict resolved.** Before: the plan says 4 tools, the code loads 11. Now consistent.
- **Known verb gaps** (e.g. rare DE conjugations like `läufst`, or technical-jargon verbs like `migriere`/`provisioniere`) → are caught by the LLM tool choice, not by the deterministic heuristic. Acceptable.
- **The brain decides on ambiguity.** When neither the allowlist nor a verb/marker match fires, the brain falls back on its own tool choice. With the ROUTER-DISCIPLINE prompt section the LLM is appropriately instructed, but not 100 % deterministic.

## Alternatives Considered

- **A third tier between `router` and `sub_jarvis`** (e.g. "router-light" for direct actions): the complexity cost (three tier configs, three tool sets, cross-tier promotion logic) without a clear gain — two tiers suffice when the router is a pure dispatcher. **Rejected.**
- **Force-spawn heuristic as an LLM routing call** (Sonnet-4.6 as a pre-classifier): an extra 200 ms latency per turn, non-deterministic. JARVIS_REFACTOR_PLAN.md had proposed this — see `docs/persona-research.md` section 5.2. **Rejected** in favor of the faster regex heuristic.
- **No tool set on the router at all** (only `spawn_sub_jarvis` as the sole tool): kills direct actions like `screen_snapshot` ("What do you see on my screen?") that the router itself should be able to answer. **Rejected.**

## Subsequent Phase-7/8 Extensions

**Status:** Amendment 2026-04-28
**Rationale:** The code has evolved past the 2026-04-25 accepted state; ROUTER_TOOLS has two additional entries plus three dynamically loaded self-mod tools. This section documents the evolution so future reviewers do not read the appearance of drift as a violation.

### What changed since 2026-04-25

```python
# jarvis/brain/factory.py (Stand 2026-04-28)
ROUTER_TOOLS = frozenset({
    # Mandat-Phase-3 Baseline (Master-Plan §22, 4 Tools)
    "run-shell",
    "screen-snapshot",
    "multi-spawn",
    "spawn-sub-jarvis",
    # Phase-5-Endstand (re-introduziert):
    "dispatch-to-harness",
    # Phase 8.4 (Quality-Gate-Pipeline):
    "dispatch-with-review",
})

# Plus drei nicht-entry_points-Tools, direkt im _load_tools_for_tier
# registriert (Phase 7.3 / Plan §AD-2 — Hauptjarvis-only Self-Mod):
SELF_MOD_TOOL_NAMES_ROUTER = frozenset({
    "list_mutable_settings",
    "get_config_value",
    "set_config_value",
})
```

### Rationale per extension

| Tool | Phase | Rationale | Recursion guard? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dispatch-to-harness` | 5 (final state) | Main Jarvis needs the direct harness path without Jarvis-Agent spawn latency. Use case: the user asks "What do you see on the screen?" → Main Jarvis calls `screen-snapshot` and immediately `dispatch-to-harness` with the observation output to a coding harness, without triggering the 30-min-hard-cap Jarvis-Agent spawn. | n/a — the tool is not self-recursive. |
| `dispatch-with-review` | 8.4 (Plan §6.4 quality-gate pipeline) | Main Jarvis calls the review pipeline explicitly. The pipeline worker IS itself a Jarvis-Agent-equivalent construct; if a Jarvis-Agent could in turn call `dispatch-with-review`, it would spawn the pipeline worker, which is again a Jarvis-Agent → a recursion vector analogous to `spawn-sub-jarvis`. | **Yes** — `SUB_TOOLS` does **not** contain the tool. Test: `test_recursive_tools_only_in_router` (`tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py`). |
| `list_mutable_settings`, `get_config_value`, `set_config_value` | 7.3 (Plan §AD-2 self-mod) | Setting mutation may only be triggered by the main-Jarvis tier. A Jarvis-Agent worker (Opus 4.7) would carry too high a privilege-escalation potential. The tools are registered directly in the loader (not via entry_points), so an accidental sub-tier activation through entry_points discovery is ruled out. | **Yes** — the tools are hardcoded main-Jarvis-only. |

### What does NOT break the mandate-spirit guarantees

- **Pure Dispatcher** is preserved: none of the Phase-7/8 tools is a direct action from the user's point of view (`open_app`, `type_text`, `search_web`, `remember`, `whoami` remain sub-tier-only). The two dispatch tools are meta-tools (they delegate to a worker), and the three self-mod tools are trivial state mutations.
- **The deterministic force-spawn heuristic** is unchanged: `_should_force_sub_jarvis` still triggers on verb/marker and respects the smalltalk allowlist.
- **The D9 recursion guard** was **extended** rather than weakened: two tools instead of one (`spawn-sub-jarvis` + `dispatch-with-review`) are explicitly excluded from `SUB_TOOLS`.
- **5 smalltalk inputs spawn 0 subprocesses** — the test `test_smalltalk_dispatches_zero_spawn_calls × 5` is still green.

### When the appearance of drift becomes a real violation

- A **direct action** migrates into `ROUTER_TOOLS` (e.g. `open-app`). → Mandate violation; the ROUTER would again know direct actions, which we already had on 2026-04-23.
- A **recursion-vector** tool migrates into `SUB_TOOLS`. → D9 violation; a Jarvis-Agent could recursively spawn.
- `_should_force_sub_jarvis` is replaced by an LLM pre-classifier. → ADR-0011 "Alternatives Considered" explicitly rejected this; a code re-introduction would be worth a new ADR.

If none of these three points occurs, the extension of the tool set is by definition within the pure-dispatcher corridor.

## Amendment 2026-05-24 — CLI-Integration (`cli-tools`)

**Status:** Amendment 2026-05-24
**Phase:** CLI-Integration (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-24-cli-integration-design.md`)

### What changed

`ROUTER_TOOLS` gains one entry: `cli-tools`.

```python
# jarvis/brain/factory.py (Stand 2026-05-24)
ROUTER_TOOLS = frozenset({
    ...,            # unchanged Phase-3/5/7/8/Awareness/B5 set
    "cli-tools",    # NEW — virtual CLI loader
})
```

`cli-tools` is a **virtual loader** (`jarvis/clis/loader.py:CliToolLoader`,
`is_virtual_loader=True`). The `_load_tools_for_tier` expansion path
(`factory.py`) recognises it and replaces the single entry with one
`cli_<name>` tool per **connected & usable** CLI (`cli_gcloud`, `cli_gh`,
`cli_docker`, …). Only connected CLIs become tools, so the router's tool
surface stays small (typically 1-5), not all 20 catalogued CLIs.

### Why it belongs in `ROUTER_TOOLS` (and nowhere else)

The first integration attempt placed CLI tools only in the legacy full-brain's
`active_tools` set, reachable solely via `JARVIS_BRAIN=legacy`. The production
path (`build_default_brain` → `_phase2_full_brain("router")` →
`_load_tools_for_tier("router")`) filters entry-points against `ROUTER_TOOLS`,
which did not contain `cli-tools` — so the default voice/chat brain never saw a
single `cli_<name>` tool. Adding `cli-tools` to `ROUTER_TOOLS` is the fix.

| Tool | Phase | Rationale | Recursion guard? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cli-tools` | CLI integration | Each expanded `cli_<name>` tool is a **direct, safety-gated action** (the user wants "list my GCP projects" answered, not delegated to a 30-min worker spawn). It is the MCP/plugin model for command-line tools. Per-CLI risk patterns (`spec.risk.{whitelist,blacklist}_patterns`) flow into the `RiskTierEvaluator` via `make_cli_patterns_fn`. | **n/a as a recursion vector** — a `cli_<name>` tool runs a subprocess, it cannot spawn the supervisor. It is router-tier only and never enters any worker tool-set (AP-5/AP-14); the deleted Jarvis-Agent tier / `SUB_TOOLS` cannot re-acquire it. |

### Pure-Dispatcher spirit is preserved

A `cli_<name>` tool is not a generic direct-action like `open_app`/`type_text`
(those stay off the router by design). It is a **gated external-system call**
with a declared binary, declared risk tier, and per-CLI allow/deny patterns —
architecturally the same shape as the existing `dispatch-to-harness`
meta-action: the router calls it directly instead of forcing a Jarvis-Agent spawn,
avoiding the spawn-latency tax for read-only CLI queries.

### Live-reload contract

Connecting/disconnecting a CLI in the UI publishes `BrainToolsChanged` (derived
from `CliStatusChanged` at the registry chokepoint), which the live
`BrainManager.refresh_tools()` consumes to re-expand `cli-tools` — no restart.
Both the brain (via `CliToolLoader.expand()`) and the safety layer (via
`make_cli_patterns_fn`) resolve the SAME shared registry
(`jarvis.clis.shared.get_active_registry`), eliminating the split-brain bug.

  built router brain; live-reload re-expand on `BrainToolsChanged`)

## Amendment 2026-05-29 — Computer-Use Router Tool (`computer-use`)

**Status:** Amendment 2026-05-29
**Phase:** Computer-Use rework Wave 1 (`~/.claude/plans/goofy-singing-piglet.md`)

### What changed

`ROUTER_TOOLS` gains a thirteenth entry: `computer-use`. It is a first-class,
clearly-described tool the router calls to drive the user's **live desktop**
(open apps, click, type, scroll, operate any GUI). Implementation:
`jarvis/plugins/tool/computer_use_tool.py:ComputerUseTool` (LLM-facing name
`computer_use`), wired in `jarvis/brain/factory.py:_load_tools_for_tier` with the
shared `HarnessManager`. It delegates to the in-process computer-use harness
(`jarvis/plugins/harness/computer_use.py` → `screenshot_only_loop.py`).

### Why it was needed (the bug)

The router previously had **no honest path** for live-desktop actions:

- `spawn-worker` runs a worker in an isolated git worktree — it can edit code
  and research, but it can **never** touch the user's live desktop.
- The router prompt told the model to reach the computer-use harness through the
  two-level `dispatch_to_harness(harness="computer-use", …)` indirection — but
  that tool's schema description only mentions "OpenClaw, Codex, code-editing,
  research" (pre-rename wording). LLMs select tools primarily by their **description**, so the model
  never picked it for desktop actions. For "Öffne ein neues Terminal für mich,
  starte darin Cloud-Konfiguration" Gemini invented a non-existent tool
  (`terminal_count`) and the anti-silence guard spoke a refusal
  (`tool_use_loop.py:407-423`; live log 2026-05-29 12:55:41).

A dedicated tool with an unambiguous name + description is the strongest signal
for LLM tool selection and removes the fragile indirection. The router prompt
(`router.py:SYSTEM_PROMPT`) was updated to route every on-screen/app/GUI action
to `computer_use` and to explicitly state that `spawn_worker` cannot touch the
desktop.

### Why it belongs in `ROUTER_TOOLS` (and nowhere else)

`computer-use` is a **direct, safety-gated action**: every individual click /
type / key inside the loop is gated through the `ToolExecutor` risk tiers
(ADR-0008). It is **not** a spawn — it cannot re-enter the supervisor, so it
carries no D9 recursion risk and never enters a worker tool-set (AP-5/AP-14).
It is router-tier only; the deleted Jarvis-Agent tier / `SUB_TOOLS` cannot
re-acquire it.

- `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py::test_router_tools_is_pure_dispatcher_set`
  (exact-match set updated to include `computer-use`)
- `tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_computer_use_tool.py` (identity, schema, dispatch
  to the `computer-use` harness, empty-goal rejection)

## Amendment: Profile-Write Router Tool (`update-profile`, 2026-05-30)

`ROUTER_TOOLS` gains `update-profile` — a deterministic, brain-driven writer
for the **structured** user profile (`data/workspace/USER.md`, the five clusters
`identity/communication/work_style/values/relationship`).

### Why a tool, and why router-tier

The Desktop App "Knowledge matrix" and the per-turn system prompt both read the
structured profile (`UserProfile.render_for_prompt()` is injected in
`manager.py:_build_system_prompt` on every turn). The legacy background
`Curator` that used to auto-write those clusters is **soft-disabled** since
2026-05-17 (`[memory.legacy_curator] enabled = false`) to avoid the "two
diverging notebooks" drift with the WikiCurator. The active WikiCurator only
writes free-form wiki **prose** — it never touches the structured clusters.
Result: durable personal facts the user states ("call me Boss", "switch to
German") never reached the structured profile, so the matrix froze and the brain
stopped learning structured facts even though it still *loaded* the (stale)
profile each turn.

`update-profile` closes that gap **without resurrecting a parallel background
extractor** (which would re-introduce the drift + a per-turn LLM cost on the
€5-VPS baseline). The brain persists a fact only when it consciously calls the
tool — exactly the `wiki-ingest` precedent, one tier up the structure ladder.

### Why it belongs in `ROUTER_TOOLS` (and nowhere else)

It is a **direct, deterministic write** (no LLM, no spawn). It is tiered
`monitor`: a real side effect (writes USER.md) that runs without a confirmation
prompt (anti-confirmation-fatigue) but is logged for audit — identical reasoning
to `wiki-ingest`. It cannot re-enter the supervisor, so it carries no D9
recursion risk and never enters a worker tool-set (AP-5/AP-14). It mutates the
**same live `UserProfile` instance** the `BrainManager` renders from (the factory
passes one instance to both `_load_tools_for_tier` and the manager), so the next
turn's system prompt reflects the change with no cache-invalidation, and it emits
`ProfileUpdated` so the Desktop matrix live-updates.

The exact-match `ROUTER_TOOLS` assertion's "no open_app/whoami" rule is
unchanged: those are delegatable direct actions. `update-profile` is a
*sanctioned write tool with its own ADR entry*, the same exception class as
`wiki-ingest`.

## Verweise

`ROUTER_TOOLS` gains `update-profile` — a deterministic, brain-driven writer
for the **structured** user profile (`data/workspace/USER.md`, the five clusters
`identity/communication/work_style/values/relationship`).

### Why a tool, and why router-tier

## Amendment (2026-05-31): App-Control Tools

Three tools join the router set so the brain has a complete grip on the Desktop
App configuration by voice/chat:

- `describe-app-settings` (safe, read-only) - a complete, secret-free snapshot:
  the active brain/TTS/STT/Jarvis-Agent provider (and which have a stored key), the
  key settings, and the configured MCP servers. The "full overview" capability.
- `switch-provider` (ask, echo-confirm) - switch *which* provider is active for a
  tier ("switch from Grok to Gemini"). Reuses the exact 3-layer persist +
  live-apply path the REST endpoints use, via `jarvis.core.runtime_refs`.
- `manage-mcp-server` (ask, echo-confirm) - add/remove/enable/disable an MCP
  server in `mcp.json` via `jarvis.mcp.state`. A newly added server starts
  **disabled** (review before activate - AP-15 spirit).

All three are direct safe/ask-gated actions, NEVER spawns - they do not enter any
worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14). Security boundary (binding): no raw secret *value*
is ever accepted. `switch-provider` only flips the active provider (the target
key must already exist in the Credential Manager); `manage-mcp-server` uses
`$SECRET_NAME` placeholders. Raw key writes stay UI-only (`/api/secrets/{key}`)
per AP-2 and the self-mod `FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS` doctrine. The shared credential
check lives in `jarvis.brain.app_control.is_credential_present` and is imported
back by `provider_routes` so the UI and the tool never drift (BUG-008 class).

Known follow-up: the deterministic pre-brain force-spawn gate
(`BrainManager._should_force_spawn`) can pre-empt utterances containing an
external-system marker (e.g. "enable the GitHub MCP") before the brain sees the
tool. The primary examples (switch Grok->Gemini, update settings, update the MCP
config) do not hit a marker. A settings-intent allowlist for the gate is deferred.

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-31-app-control-tools-design.md`.

## Amendment: AI Pointer Router Tool (`inspect-pointer`, 2026-06-01)

`inspect-pointer` is added to `ROUTER_TOOLS` (risk `safe`, read-only). It
resolves the on-screen UI element under the mouse cursor via the OS
accessibility tree (`IUIAutomation.ElementFromPoint` / `AXUIElement​
CopyElementAtPosition` / AT-SPI `getAccessibleAtPoint`) — not a blind
screenshot — and returns its name/role/value/app. It is a **direct safe-gated
read, never a spawn**, so it never enters a worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14).

This is the *pull* path for deictic questions ("what is this?", "was ist das
da?"). The *push* path is separate and lives off the router schema: a fast
regex deictic gate (`jarvis.pointer.intent`) in `BrainManager.generate()` rides
the resolved element (+ a tight crop only for unlabeled graphics) on the turn
context, off the voice hot path with a hard timeout (AP-9). The gate vetoes
demonstratives completed by a concrete noun ("was ist das *für ein Wetter*"), so
unrelated turns never receive cursor context — the "no context-less garbage"
contract. Every backend degrades to a logged null fallback (AD-6); the headless
€5-VPS path resolves no cursor and the brain says so.

Spec: `docs/plans/ai-pointer/DESIGN.md`. Regression guards:
`tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py` (`inspect-pointer` in the dispatcher set),
`tests/unit/pointer/`, `tests/unit/brain/test_manager_pointer.py`.

## Amendment: Navigate tool (`navigate`, 2026-06-02)

`navigate` is added to `ROUTER_TOOLS` (risk `safe`). It moves the desktop UI to a
sidebar section in response to a spoken/typed command ("zeig die Socials", "open
settings", "show the agents", "geh zu den Aufgaben"). The tool takes a `section`
argument, normalizes natural-language aliases (DE + EN) to a canonical section
id, and publishes a `NavigateSidebar` event on the shared bus. The WS forwarder
streams it to the frontend (`event_name = "NavigateSidebar"`), whose existing
listener (`useWebSocket.ts`) calls `setActiveSection` when the id is a known
`SectionId` and otherwise no-ops gracefully.

It is a **pure UI action with no side effects beyond switching the visible
screen** — a direct safe-gated action, **never a spawn**, so it never enters a
worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14). This is why it belongs in `ROUTER_TOOLS` and
nowhere else: the router is the only tier that talks to the UI; a worker runs in
an isolated worktree and has no UI bus.

Anti-drift: the tool's `KNOWN` section ids mirror the frontend `SECTION_IDS`
(`jarvis/ui/web/frontend/src/store/events.ts`); a parity test reads the TS array
and asserts equality, so a new section added on one side without the other fails
CI (the wire-format-enum guard from `docs/anti-drift-three-layer.md`). The
frontend's `isSectionId` check is the second layer of defense — an unknown id is
ignored, never a crash.

Regression guards: `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py`
(`test_navigate_in_router_tools`), `tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_navigate.py`
(alias normalization, unknown-section failure, SECTION_IDS parity).

## Amendment: Contacts Tools (`contact-lookup`, `contact-upsert`, `call-contact`, 2026-06-02)

Three tools are added to `ROUTER_TOOLS` for the `jarvis-contacts` feature (the
user-curated contact book + acting on a person by name). This is **Chunk B** of
the plan `hallo-es-geht-darum-rosy-hinton.md`; it consumes two frozen contracts
(`ContactStore`, owned by Chunk A; `place_call`, owned by Chunk C) and degrades
gracefully when either is absent (cloud-first €5-VPS no-op).

- **`contact-lookup`** (risk `safe`, read-only) — resolves a name/alias to the
  contact's e-mails/phones/address/README via `ContactStore.find_by_alias`. The
  brain calls it FIRST whenever the user names a person for an action, then
  chains into `gmail` or `call-contact`.
- **`contact-upsert`** (risk `monitor`, deterministic write) — saves/updates a
  contact by voice ("merk dir Christophs Nummer ist …"). Logged, no confirmation
  nag (anti-confirmation-fatigue), mirroring `wiki-ingest`. Deletion stays
  UI-only in v1.
- **`call-contact`** (risk `ask`, echo-confirm) — resolves the contact's phone
  and places a **real outbound call** via the telephony engine (`place_call`,
  Contract 2). Telephony absent/unconfigured → a clear English no-op pointing at
  the Telephony section.

All three are **direct safe/monitor/ask-gated actions, never a spawn**, so they
never enter a worker tool-set (AP-5/AP-14). E-mail-by-name needs **no new tool**:
a system-prompt rule in `manager._build_system_prompt()` (emitted only when
`contact-lookup` AND `gmail` are both wired) tells the brain to resolve the name
via `contact-lookup`, then send via the existing `gmail` tool.

**Capability coupling (the BUG-class fix).** The three tools are also registered
as capabilities in `capabilities_seed.py` (`tool.contact-lookup`/`-upsert`/
`-call-contact`). This is load-bearing: without the `call-contact` capability,
`resolve_intent("ruf Christoph an")` returns `None`, so
`BrainManager._is_generic_subagent_work` treats it as generic work and
**force-spawns a contextless worker** that cannot place a call — the live BUG
documented in `project_bug_subagent_not_natively_recognized`. Registering the
capability makes `resolve_intent` return `tool.call-contact`, which flips the
verdict from spawn to no-spawn so the utterance stays router-tier. The contact
verbs deliberately EXCLUDE the dispatch hard-negative verbs
(schick/sende/trag/bestelle/poste) so the anti-hallucination contract
(`test_capability_coupling_e2e`) is preserved — the canonical "schick eine Email
an …" / "trag einen Termin ein" still resolve to `None` and stay UNSUPPORTED.

## Amendment: Inline web search (`search-web`) + heavy-only spawn threshold (2026-06-10)

### What changed

1. `ROUTER_TOOLS` gains `search-web` (`jarvis/plugins/tool/search_web.py:
   SearchWebTool`, LLM-facing name `search_web`). Read-only DuckDuckGo
   Instant-Answer call via `httpx`, risk `safe`, no key required —
   cloud-first compatible (plain HTTPS, works on the €5-VPS baseline).
2. The router system prompt (`router.py:SYSTEM_PROMPT`) replaces the
   "research/analysis/comparison → spawn_worker" doctrine and the
   "on uncertainty: delegate" default with an effort-based three-way split:
   - LIGHT: answer directly, no tool.
   - MEDIUM: finish it YOURSELF this turn with the router's own tools
     (`search_web`, plugin tools, `cli_*`, `run_shell`, `computer_use`,
     `wiki-recall`) — multiple tool calls and a few seconds of thinking are
     fine. Never a spawn.
   - HEAVY: `spawn_worker` ONLY when the task builds a real work product
     (code/app/file/document/HTML report/refactor) or clearly needs
     multi-minute, multi-step focused work — or the user explicitly asks
     for a background agent.
   On uncertainty the router now tries itself first ("BEI UNSICHERHEIT:
   MACH ES SELBST") instead of delegating.
3. The `spawn_worker` tool description was rewritten to the same heavy-only
   contract with an explicit negative boundary (questions, news, single
   lookups are NEVER spawned). LLMs select tools primarily by description —
   the lesson from the 2026-05-29 computer-use amendment, applied in the
   restrictive direction.

### Why (the bug)

Live complaint 2026-06-10: "was sind die aktuellsten News?" spawned a
multi-minute worker mission. Root cause was twofold:

- The prompt classified EVERY research-ish utterance as SPAWN_WORKER
  ("Recherche, Analyse, Vergleich", "ALLES was laenger als ~5 Sekunden
  dauert", "BEI UNSICHERHEIT: DELEGIERE") and falsely framed delegation as
  costing "wenige Sekunden" — a real mission runs minutes.
- The router had NO inline web path at all: `search_web` existed as a
  plugin but was deliberately kept out of `ROUTER_TOOLS` (the 2026-05-25
  phantom-tool fix removed the *advertisement* instead of registering the
  *tool*), so the model literally could not answer a news question except
  by spawning.

The deterministic force-spawn heuristic was NOT involved (a question
carries no action verb); the LLM tool-choice path was. The heuristic is
therefore unchanged by this amendment.

### Why `search-web` belongs in `ROUTER_TOOLS` (and nowhere else)

It is a **direct, read-only, safe-gated lookup** — architecturally the same
shape as `wiki-recall` (read-only search the router answers from). It is
not a generic direct action like `open_app`/`type_text` (those stay
delegated): it has no side effects, needs no confirmation, and answering a
question inline is exactly the router's job. It is never a spawn and never
enters a worker tool-set (AP-5/AP-14). The 2026-05-25 phantom-call bug
class cannot recur in the inverse direction because the parity test now
pins BOTH halves: tool registered ↔ tool advertised
(`tests/unit/brain/test_router_prompt_tool_parity.py::
test_search_web_is_a_real_router_tool_and_advertised`).

### Pure-dispatcher spirit

This amendment formalizes what the 2026-05-24/05-29/06-01 amendments
already practiced: the router answers light AND medium requests directly
through safe-gated tools and reserves the heavy worker for genuinely heavy
chunks. The "When in doubt, SPAWN" reflex that ADR-0011 §Context originally
diagnosed as the *bug* had crept back into the prompt as doctrine; this
amendment removes it again — in the opposite direction this time
(over-spawning instead of over-acting).

- `tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_spawn_worker_description.py` (heavy-only
  description contract)

### Related model pin (same user mandate, 2026-06-10)

The heavy tier itself was pinned to the frontier model `claude-fable-5`
with NO automatic `claude-opus-*` fallback anywhere:
`[brain.sub_jarvis] provider="claude-api", model="claude-fable-5"`,
`[brain.providers.claude-api].deep_model="claude-fable-5"`,
`claude_direct_worker._DEFAULT_CLAUDE_MODEL`, critic escalation
(`jarvis/missions/critic/escalation.py` — escalation rounds now target
`FRONTIER_MODEL` instead of the `"opus"` CLI alias), and the computer-use
planner default (`config.py plan_model`). Drift-guard source
`scripts/config-soll.json` updated in the same change so the pin survives
the 5-minute drift sweep (BUG-010 triple defense).

## Amendment 2026-06-18 — MCP-Tools Virtual Loader (`mcp-tools`)

**Status:** Amendment 2026-06-18

### What changed

`ROUTER_TOOLS` gains one entry: `mcp-tools`.

`mcp-tools` is a **virtual loader** (`jarvis/mcp/loader.py:McpToolLoader`,
`is_virtual_loader=True`). The `_load_tools_for_tier` expansion path
(`factory.py`) recognises it and replaces the single entry with one
`MCPToolAdapter` per tool of every **connected and running** MCP server
(e.g. `notebooklm-mcp`, `filesystem-mcp`). Only running servers contribute
tools, so the router's tool surface stays proportional to what is actually
connected.

### Why it was needed (the bug)

Connected MCP servers (e.g. `notebooklm-mcp`, 32 tools) were invisible to
the voice/router brain. Root cause: `_load_tools_for_tier` discovers tools
via `jarvis.tool` entry-points filtered against `ROUTER_TOOLS`. Both
`cli-tools` and `plugin-tools` are virtual loaders in that set — but there
was no equivalent for MCP tools. The `MCPToolAdapter` objects created at
server-connect time never entered the brain's tool dict.

### Implementation

- **`jarvis/mcp/loader.py`** — new `McpToolLoader`, structured exactly like
  `PluginToolLoader` (mirror of `jarvis/marketplace/plugin_loader.py`).
  Reads `client._tools_cache` **synchronously** (already populated during
  `MCPClient.start()`) — no network I/O, no `await`, no server start.
  Every failure path returns `[]` so a broken MCP server cannot crash the
  factory.
- **`pyproject.toml`** — `[project.entry-points."jarvis.tool"]` gains
  `mcp-tools = "jarvis.mcp.loader:McpToolLoader"`.
- **`jarvis/brain/factory.py`** — `"mcp-tools"` added to `ROUTER_TOOLS`.
- **`jarvis/core/capabilities.py`** — `_reset_registry_for_tests()` helper
  added (test-only) so the `MCPToolAdapter` side-effect of registering a
  `Capability` in the global singleton does not leak across tests.

| Tool | Phase | Rationale | Recursion guard? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mcp-tools` | MCP connectivity | Each expanded `MCPToolAdapter` is a **direct, risk-gated action** (default `monitor`). It is the same virtual-loader model as `cli-tools` and `plugin-tools`. The router calls MCP tools inline rather than delegating to a 30-min worker spawn. | **n/a as a recursion vector** — an `MCPToolAdapter.execute()` calls the MCP server subprocess, it cannot spawn the supervisor. It is router-tier only and never enters any worker tool-set (AP-5/AP-14). |

### Live-reload contract

Connecting/disconnecting an MCP server publishes `BrainToolsChanged`, which
the live `BrainManager.refresh_tools()` consumes to re-expand `mcp-tools`
— no restart required (owned by WS2).

### Regression guards

- `tests/unit/mcp/test_loader.py` — 6 cases: expand returns adapters, null
  registry → `[]`, raising `active_clients` → `[]`, multiple servers, empty
  clients, loader attributes.

- `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py::test_router_tools_is_pure_dispatcher_set`
  (exact-match set updated to include `mcp-tools`)

## Amendment — Marketplace native tools `gmail`, `vercel`, `google_calendar`

A connected marketplace plugin that has **no MCP server block** (so the virtual
`mcp-tools`/`plugin-tools` loaders expand to nothing for it) must be made
router-visible **directly**, or a voice/chat command can never reach it. Three
such native tools are in `ROUTER_TOOLS`:

| Tool | Added | Backing | Risk | Recursion guard? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gmail` | 2026-06-01 | Gmail REST API via the marketplace OAuth token | `ask` (send is consequential; reads downgrade to `safe` via `risk_tier_for_args`) | n/a — a direct REST call, not a spawn; router-tier only (AP-5/AP-14) |
| `vercel` | 2026-06-07 | Vercel REST API via the marketplace PAT | `monitor` (read-only) | n/a — direct REST call, never a spawn |
| `google_calendar` | 2026-06-27 | Google Calendar API v3 via a **Node bot** (`calendar_bot.mjs`); a thin Python bridge reuses the marketplace OAuth token + refresh loop | `monitor` (writes), `safe` (reads) via `risk_tier_for_args` — **full autonomy, never `ask`** (user mandate) | n/a — the bridge runs a short-lived `node` subprocess for one API call, it cannot spawn the supervisor; router-tier only, never enters a worker set (AP-5/AP-14) |

Same spirit as `cli-tools`: a **gated external-system call** with a declared
risk tier and the marketplace token model — not a generic direct-action like
`open_app`/`type_text` (those stay off the router by design). The token never
expires in practice because the bridge self-heals on a 401 (refresh once +
retry) and the `RefreshScheduler` keeps the refresh token warm.

### Regression guards

- `tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_google_calendar_rest.py` — 13 cases: per-action
  payloads, 401 → one refresh + retry, no action is ever `ask` (full autonomy),
  graceful "not connected" / "node missing".
- `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py::test_router_tools_is_pure_dispatcher_set`
  (exact-match set updated to include `google_calendar`).

## Amendment — `dispatch-to-harness` removed from the LLM-visible router set (2026-06-28)

**Forensic.** A user said by voice, in effect, *"start a subagent that writes me
a study sheet."* Jarvis replied: *"the harness 'openclaw' is not available;
active are only mcp-remote, open-interpreter, python-script and screenshot."*
The brain had chosen `dispatch_to_harness(harness="openclaw", …)` instead of
`spawn_worker`. `HarnessManager.get("openclaw")` raised a `KeyError`, and its raw
message — including the internal active/failed harness inventory — was read
aloud.

**Root cause.** `dispatch-to-harness` exposed a free-form `harness` string
parameter and its description advertised *"OpenClaw, Codex, Python-Script, MCP"*
as Jarvis-Agent vehicles. But the legacy OpenClaw harness name is **not a registered harness** — it was
removed in Welle 4 (~92% nested-claude hang; see `docs/BUGS.md`), and
`pyproject.toml` registers only `open-interpreter`, `mcp-remote`,
`python-script`, `screenshot`. So a "Jarvis-Agent" turn could name a phantom harness
that can never run. The capability surface compounded it: `tool.spawn-worker`
was described as *"Spawn an OpenClaw sub-agent"* and a separate
`harness.openclaw` capability advertised the dead vehicle.

**Decision.** `dispatch-to-harness` is **removed from `ROUTER_TOOLS`** — it is no
longer an LLM-selectable tool. The two legitimate paths are unchanged and
sufficient:

- **heavy Jarvis-Agent work → `spawn-worker`** (Mission-Manager → `ClaudeDirectWorker`);
- **live desktop control → `computer-use`**.

The `DispatchToHarnessTool` class is **retained** for the internal, non-LLM
local-action / computer-use fast path (`_load_local_action_tools`, invoked
programmatically with a registered harness name). It is just not router-visible.
Do **not** re-add it to `ROUTER_TOOLS` — that resurrects the phantom-harness
routing bug.

Companion changes: the dead `tool.dispatch-to-harness` and `harness.openclaw`
capabilities are deleted from the seed; `tool.spawn-worker` is re-described
(*"Spawn a background worker sub-agent"*) with its `openclaw` verbs/objects
removed; the `HarnessManager.get()` / `dispatch_to_harness` error paths no longer
leak the raw harness inventory into a message that can reach voice; and the boot
path logs a warning when an inert `[harness.openclaw].enabled = true` block is
present (`warn_if_phantom_worker_harness`).

## Amendment — `app-command` tool (Command Registry executor, 2026-07-09)

**Context.** Voice-driven app control had three uneven paths: the deterministic
pre-LLM gates (fast, but only for a hand-picked set), the self-mod
`set_config_value` tools, and free-form `cli_jarvisctl` strings composed by the
LLM — the least-validated route and the primary source of "the command did
something else" failures. Meanwhile the app's command surface lived in four
independent, hand-maintained registries (UI nav, CLI, brain tools, mirrored
constants — the AP-4 drift class).

**Decision.** `ROUTER_TOOLS` gains **`app-command`**
(`jarvis/plugins/tool/app_command.py`): a single structured executor over the
new Command Registry (`jarvis/commands/registry.py`). Constraints:

- `command_id` is **enum-constrained** to the curated registry — the LLM cannot
  invent a target; arguments are validated against the command's JSON schema
  BEFORE anything is sent.
- Execution goes through the SAME mounted REST endpoint the desktop UI uses,
  in-process via httpx `ASGITransport` (`runtime_refs.get_web_app()`) — one
  validation chain for voice, UI, and CLI.
- Registry commands flagged `dangerous` escalate to risk tier `ask` via
  `risk_tier_for_args` (ToolExecutor two-turn voice confirm); the rest run at
  `monitor`.
- The readback is composed from the SERVER RESPONSE (echo-verify), never from
  the model's intent.
- **No spawn path:** mission dispatch is deliberately NOT a registry command
  (spawning stays with `spawn-worker`); `app-command` is a direct gated action
  and must never enter a worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14).

The deterministic pre-LLM gates stay untouched — they remain the zero-latency
first line; `app-command` covers the validated long tail. `cli_jarvisctl`
remains as fallback for actions outside the registry.

### Regression guards

  (exact-match set updated to include `app-command`)
- `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py::test_factory_wires_app_command_into_router_set`
- `tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_app_command.py` — schema/enum validation,
  ASGI execution against a fake app, dangerous→ask escalation, server-response
  readback, honest no-server error.
- `tests/unit/commands/test_registry_parity.py` — registry↔OpenAPI/UI parity.

### Addendum (2026-07-11) — umbrella interface replaced by flat expansion

The original `app-command` design (ONE tool, nested `command_id` + `args`)
failed its first live test: the router LLM read the command list in the
tool description and called `provider-test` AS A TOOL NAME — "tool
'provider-test' not in the router tool set", spoken error. Flash-class
routers flatten nested dispatch interfaces; the repo's own CLI/MCP loaders
already solved this shape. `app-command` is therefore now a **virtual
loader** (the `cli-tools` pattern): the ROUTER_TOOLS entry gates the loader,
`expand()` registers one flat tool per registry command (`brain-switch`,
`provider-test`, `wake-word-set`, …), each carrying the command's own params
schema and risk tier (`ask` when dangerous, else `monitor`). Validation,
ASGI execution, and echo-verify readback are unchanged. Guards:
`test_factory_wires_registry_command_tools_into_router_set`,
`tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_app_command.py` (loader expansion + flat
schemas + the provider-test regression).

## Amendment 2026-07-12 - retire `multi-spawn` from the router

### Context

The live harness inventory no longer contains the historical Jarvis-Agent/Codex
vehicles advertised by `multi-spawn`. The tool therefore competed with the
working `spawn-worker` mission path while offering backend names that could not
run. This is the same phantom-capability failure class that previously required
removing `dispatch-to-harness` from the LLM-visible router.

### Decision

`multi-spawn` is removed from `ROUTER_TOOLS` and from the seeded capability
registry. `spawn-worker` is the sole LLM-visible heavy-work delegation path; its
Mission Manager may still decompose a mission into parallel supervised steps.
The legacy implementation and entry point may remain for internal compatibility,
but model-facing schemas and prompts must not advertise it.

### Consequences

- Heavy work has one observable mission id and one critic/review lifecycle.
- The router can no longer select unregistered harness names through the legacy
  fan-out schema.
- Parallelism remains an internal Mission Manager decision rather than a second
  public spawn surface.

### Alternatives considered

- Re-register the historical harness names: rejected because those backends were
  removed after empirical reliability failures.
- Rewrite `multi-spawn` as an alias for `spawn-worker`: rejected because two
  model-visible tools for one operation recreate nondeterministic tool choice.

### Follow-up items

- Keep exact router-set and capability-registry negative tests.
- Keep recursive spawn tools out of every worker capability inventory.

## Amendment 2026-07-13 - retire `dispatch-with-review` from the router

### Context

`dispatch-with-review` still exposed the retired Phase-8 review pipeline as a
second model-visible heavy-work path. Its worker spawner can only select the
unregistered `jarvis_agent` or `openclaw` harness names, while the production
Mission Manager already applies `CriticRunner` to every supervised mission.
Keeping both tools made an otherwise valid Realtime action nondeterministically
choose a path that cannot execute on any supported installation.

### Decision

Remove `dispatch-with-review` from `ROUTER_TOOLS` and from the seeded capability
registry. `spawn-worker` is the sole model-visible heavy-work entry point, and
its Mission Manager owns worker execution, critic retries, and Kontrollierer
sign-off. The legacy review entry point may remain temporarily for internal
compatibility, but routing, capability discovery, and prompts must not advertise
it.

### Consequences

- Realtime, chat, and voice all enter the same supervised mission lifecycle.
- Every model-selected heavy task receives the live worker fallback chain and
  the production Critic instead of an unavailable harness error.
- Existing direct callers of the legacy review tool continue to receive its
  compatibility behavior until the implementation is removed or migrated.
- Two model-visible tools can no longer compete for the same reviewed mission.

### Alternatives considered

- Re-register the retired harnesses: rejected because the Jarvis-Agent (formerly
  OpenClaw) subprocess path was removed after repeated reliability failures.
- Rewrite `dispatch-with-review` as a second alias for `spawn-worker`: rejected
  because duplicate schemas recreate nondeterministic model selection and split
  telemetry across two names.
- Keep both tools and improve the prompt: rejected because prompt guidance
  cannot make an unregistered execution backend available.

### Follow-up items

- Keep negative router and capability-registry tests for
  `dispatch-with-review`.
- Preserve the Mission Manager Critic-loop smoke test as the review guarantee.
- Remove the legacy review implementation once non-router compatibility callers
  have migrated.

## Amendment 2026-07-13 - advertise only operational harness adapters

### Context

The package still registered `mcp-remote` and `open-interpreter` as harnesses.
The former implemented an obsolete MCP client API and bootstrapped with an empty
registry; the latter was an explicit stub that always returned failure. Their
presence in entry-point discovery and the default `[harness].enabled` list made
unavailable functionality look ready on a fresh installation.

### Decision

The operational harness inventory contains only `python-script` and the
capability-gated `screenshot` Computer Use adapter. MCP servers contribute flat,
safety-gated tools through the live MCP loader; they are not worker harnesses.
Any mission-scoped worker grants must reuse that tool surface rather than revive
the obsolete harness adapter. Heavy work continues through `spawn-worker` and
the Mission Manager. Stale configured harness names are reported by the doctor.

### Consequences

- Discovery no longer claims that a stub or obsolete protocol adapter can run.
- The universal Python harness remains available on a headless base install.
- Computer Use remains registered but reports unhealthy until its desktop
  context and dependencies are ready.
- MCP actions retain the normal ToolExecutor policy instead of bypassing it
  through the obsolete harness adapter.

## Amendment 2026-07-14 - `wiki-list` tool (grounded vault listing)

**Status:** Amendment 2026-07-14

### Context

Voice session 2026-07-14 09:29 ("what is in my wiki"): the delegated
router turn had no way to enumerate the Obsidian vault. It probed blindly
(`wiki-recall` -> `wiki-page-read index.md` -> not found -> `SOUL.md` ->
not found), burned ~14 sequential LLM rounds (66 s wall clock), and
finally recited the EXAMPLE directory layout from `schema.md` (the
vault's editing contract, `type: meta`) as if it were the actual vault
contents. Every file named in the spoken answer was invented, and the
invented facts were then journaled by the fact extractor — a
self-reinforcing hallucination loop.

### Decision

`ROUTER_TOOLS` gains `wiki-list`
(`jarvis/plugins/tool/wiki_list.py::WikiListTool`): a read-only,
risk-`safe`, deterministic listing of every markdown page in the vault
(vault-relative path, size, first heading), with `type: meta` contract
pages explicitly flagged as system files. Overview questions ("what is
in my wiki / my notes") resolve in ONE tool round against ground truth
instead of a probe-and-guess loop. Complementarily, `wiki-page-read`
prepends a deterministic provenance warning when serving a `type: meta`
page.

The router remains a pure dispatcher: the tool is a direct safe-gated read,
never a spawn. Jarvis-Agents may access it only through ADR-0025's
mission-scoped supervisor broker; the live object and vault path remain in the
supervisor, and it never enters a legacy worker tier or direct worker tool set
(AP-5/AP-14).

## Amendment 2026-07-25 — `home_assistant` router tool

### Context

Home Assistant is the connector where "assistant" is the literal use case:
lights, heating, doors, scenes. It reached the catalog as a `pat_paste` plugin
with a per-connection instance address, so the question was how a connected
smart home becomes callable by voice.

Its MCP integration is not the answer. Home Assistant has explicitly declined
RFC 7591 dynamic client registration, and its MCP server is deliberately scoped
to Home Assistant's own Assist pipeline — it exposes conversation, not the
entity and service surface an external assistant needs. The documented REST API
does expose exactly that.

### Decision

`ROUTER_TOOLS` gains `home_assistant`
(`jarvis/plugins/tool/home_assistant_rest.py::HomeAssistantRestTool`): list
entities (optionally by domain), read one entity's state, and call a service.

Two properties are load-bearing:

- **The server address is per-connection state**, stored in
  `Tokens.extra["instance_url"]` beside the credential rather than hardcoded.
  Home Assistant runs on the user's own network; there is no canonical
  endpoint, and the `.local` hostname does not resolve inside Docker or over a
  VPN.
- **risk_tier is `ask`, not `monitor`.** Every other native marketplace tool is
  read-focused. This one physically changes the user's home. Turning off the
  wrong light is recoverable; unlocking a door is not, so the safety layer
  decides rather than the tool.

The router remains a pure dispatcher: this is a direct gated action, never a
spawn, and it never enters a worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14). Jarvis-Agents reach
it only through ADR-0025's mission-scoped supervisor broker.

### Consequences

The long-lived access token is valid for ten years with no rotation, which
makes this the most durable connection in the catalog — and the reason the
setup text asks for a dedicated non-admin Home Assistant user, since the token
inherits every permission of whoever created it.

Reachability, not authentication, is the honest limitation: a headless Jarvis
on a server cannot see a home LAN without a remote URL or a tunnel. The tool
reports that as a network problem instead of implying a bad credential.

## Amendment: UltraWiki Search (2026-07-25)

`ultrawiki-search` joins `ROUTER_TOOLS`: the read-only pull primitive over
the UltraWiki semantic store (fused keyword + vector retrieval with citation
permalinks, `jarvis/plugins/tool/ultrawiki_search.py`). Direct safe-gated
read, never a spawn (AP-5/AP-14). Resolver-not-instance wiring (the
UltraWikiService is built by the WebServer after the brain — the wiki-ingest
lazy-curator precedent); the tool loads even while UltraWiki mode is
disabled and answers with an honest steer to the classic `wiki-*` tools, so
the router's tool surface stays stable across mode toggles. Mission workers
reach it only through the ADR-0025 broker grant once the ADR-0030 gate is
live. A dedicated `who_is` primitive stays DEFERRED until the UltraWiki P5
identity layer exists; until then `ultrawiki-search` answers "who is X"
queries via hybrid search.

### Regression guards

- `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py` (ROUTER_TOOLS exact set)

## Amendment: Assistant-Mode Tools (2026-08-13)

`list-modes`, `switch-mode` and `save-mode` join `ROUTER_TOOLS`: the assistant
can now read, switch and author its own *mode* — the character it answers in
(`jarvis/brain/modes.py`, `jarvis/plugins/tool/assistant_mode.py`).

The precedent is `switch-provider`, not `open_app`. These tools reconfigure the
assistant itself; they run in-process, touch no external system, and their
result is deterministic. Nothing here is a direct action on the user's machine,
so nothing here belongs behind the Jarvis-Agent bridge. Direct gated actions,
never spawns, never in a worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14).

Tiers are set by what each one can actually cost:

- `list-modes` — safe. A property read over the mode directory.
- `switch-mode` — monitor. It changes tone and nothing else, the app-wide mode
  indicator shows it the moment it happens, and undoing it is one sentence.
  Confirming a change of character the user just asked for out loud would be
  paperwork, not safety.
- `save-mode` — ask, echo-confirmed. It writes a file that every future turn
  reads, under a name the model chose from a conversation. The confirmation is
  the natural last beat of the mode-builder interview and is what stops a
  half-heard sentence from becoming a permanent character.

A mode is layered onto the base persona, never substituted for it
(`persona_loader.load_effective_persona_prompt`), so no mode — including one the
model wrote itself — can drop the standing rules about honesty and about what is
safe to say aloud. `save_mode` is told not to restate those rules, because a
mode that appears to own them invites a later one to relax them.

The Agentic IDE's coding mode is applied as an in-memory *section override*
rather than a persisted choice, so a mode a screen switched on cannot outlive
the process.

- `tests/unit/brain/test_modes.py`
- `tests/integration/test_modes_routes.py`

### Retired (2026-08-23)

The assistant-modes feature was removed on the maintainer's decision: the
shelf of characters, `jarvis/brain/modes.py`, the `/api/modes` routes, the
`jarvis modes` CLI group, the Modes section and the three router tools above
are gone, and `ROUTER_TOOLS` no longer lists them. `load_effective_persona_prompt`
is back to "custom override, else default" with no mode layer, and the Agentic
IDE's focused coding mode no longer swaps the persona's character — it still
adds the workspace facts to the prompt and gates spawns as before. This
section stays as history; the reasoning above is what to re-read if a
character layer is ever wanted again.

## Amendment: `create-skill` router tool (2026-08-18)

`create-skill` joins `ROUTER_TOOLS`: the brain can now WRITE a new skill from
the user's spoken description (`jarvis/plugins/tool/create_skill.py`).

### Context

Voice session 2026-08-18 17:51: "Ich möchte, dass du mir bitte einen neuen
Skill erstellst — Morgenroutine, jeden Morgen um 6 Uhr E-Mails, Linear-Tickets
und Kalender vorlesen, dann ein 80er-Klassiker auf YouTube Music."
Three things went wrong at once, and each was structural:

1. **The wrong skill captured the turn.** The trigger channel captures on the
   longest author regex, and `plugin-youtube_music`'s brand-only trigger
   matched the words INSIDE the description of the skill to be built. The
   `skill-creator` builtin's own trigger knew only the infinitive ("Skill
   erstellen"), not the conjugated verb the user said ("Skill erstellst").
2. **The brain had no tool to write a skill.** The only live authoring path
   was the UI dialog (`POST /api/skills/creator/{draft,commit}`) and, two
   commands deep, `jarvisctl skills draft` + `commit` with JSON piped between
   them. The model spent three tool rounds on `jarvisctl --help`, hit the 45 s
   loop deadline and said "Das hat gerade nicht geklappt."
3. **Even that path could produce a template, not a skill.** The creator's
   deterministic skeleton copies the intent 1:1 into `description` and a body
   that says "1. …", never derives a schedule trigger, and its single brain
   call died on the dev box's unkeyed active provider.

The 2026-07-25 note that a router tool "would be a third route to the same
behaviour and a fourth place to forget the AP-15 guard" was reasoning about
the phantom `spawn-skill-author`; the guard is enforced in ONE place
(`SkillCreatorService.commit` forces `state="draft"`), so a tool that calls
that service adds a caller, not a place to forget.

### Decision

- `jarvis/skills/authoring_request.py` — a deterministic resolver ahead of the
  trigger channel (Channel 0.5 in `BrainManager._match_skill_for_turn`): word
  "skill" + a creation shape (indefinite/new article, or a creation verb in
  any conjugation right before/after the noun) + not an information question.
  An authoring request resolves to the active `skill-creator` builtin with
  trigger-grade rights, or to NO skill when that builtin is off — never to a
  connector named inside the request. Force-spawn and the evidence gate stand
  down on such a turn (`_skill_authoring_turn`).
- `create-skill` (monitor): ONE bounded call — live tool inventory + installed
  skills → the brain ladder (active provider → Tool Model → quality tier →
  frontier chain, crossing on a dead rung, AP-21/AP-22) → a complete draft
  (name, description, spoken trigger regex, schedule cron when a time was
  named, numbered steps per connected tool, spoken answer format) → committed
  as `state: draft` (AP-15). Never a skeleton: without an authoring brain the
  tool fails honestly and writes nothing (`SkillCreatorUnavailable`).
- Parity across surfaces (§3 provider & mode parity): the same
  `SkillCreatorService.author()` backs `POST /api/skills/creator/author` and
  `jarvis skills create`; the realtime engines reach it through the delegate
  router brain like every other router tool; the UI dialog keeps its
  review-then-commit flow and now sees the same tool inventory.
- The `skill-creator` builtin's body is a short card ("restate, call
  create-skill once, report") — Anthropic's 450-line guide moved to
  `references/anthropic-skill-creator.md`; its regex accepts conjugated verbs.

Direct gated action, never a spawn, never in a worker tool set (AP-5/AP-14).

#### Same day, generalised — the class, not the instance

The first cut protected only the literal word "skill" and only creation. The
maintainer's objection ("why not automatically — this applies to many other
things") is right, and the two failure classes are:

1. *A brand mentioned inside a request ABOUT an internal artifact captures the
   turn.* The resolver now covers every noun this product uses for "a skill"
   in speech — routine (incl. compounds: "Morgenroutine"), automation /
   "Automatisierung", workflow, "Ablauf", "Fähigkeit", ES "rutina" /
   "automatización" / "flujo" — and a second kind, **lifecycle**: "deaktiviere
   / lösch / zeig / disable / delete / list … den Skill X" lets nobody
   capture (veto `skill_lifecycle_request`), so the brand skill named inside
   never RUNS instead of being switched off.
2. *The brain has no first-class tool and burns rounds on `--help`.* Two
   closures: (a) the skill lifecycle is in the Command Registry —
   `skills-list` (new lean `GET /api/skills/brief`), `skill-enable`,
   `skill-disable`, `skill-delete` (dangerous, echo-confirmed) — flat
   `app-command` tools the model sees by name; (b) the `cli_jarvisctl` tool's
   description carries the WHOLE command tree
   (`jarvis/cli_ctl/command_index.py`, static, parity-tested against the live
   Typer app) with argument hints, so workflows, modes, tasks, wiki, board,
   contacts, missions … are all one direct call away — the general fix for the
   `--help`-round class, not a per-feature patch.

Regression guards for the generalisation: `tests/unit/skills/test_authoring_request.py`
(routine / automation / workflow positives, lifecycle kind, hard negatives such
as "schalt das Licht aus" and "starte die Morgenroutine"),
`tests/unit/brain/test_skill_authoring_turn.py` (disable request not captured;
automation request → skill-creator), `tests/unit/commands/test_registry_parity.py`
(new entries exist in OpenAPI), `tests/unit/cli_ctl/test_command_index_parity.py`,
`tests/unit/clis/test_tool.py` (jarvisctl description carries the index).

### Regression guards

- `tests/unit/skills/test_authoring_request.py` (the live transcript, hits and
  hard negatives)
- `tests/unit/brain/test_skill_authoring_turn.py` (youtube_music no longer
  captures the authoring turn; stand-downs)
- `tests/unit/plugins/test_create_skill_tool.py` (registered, router-visible,
  loader-constructible; draft on disk; honest failure writes nothing)
- `tests/unit/skills/test_creator_service.py` (brain ladder crossover,
  inventory in the prompt, trigger normalisation, `author()` refuses a
  skeleton, collision suffix)
- `tests/unit/ui/web/test_skills_routes.py`, `tests/unit/cli_ctl/test_commands_wave23.py`
- `tests/fixtures/skill_routing/golden.yaml` (forensic positive)

## Amendment: `create-artifact` router tool (2026-08-23)

`create-artifact` joins `ROUTER_TOOLS` and replaces the 2026-08-11 `visualize`
tool: the brain can have ONE self-contained page built — a dashboard, a
report, a diagram, a small interactive tool — and shown full-size in the
Artifacts section (`jarvis/plugins/tool/create_artifact.py`).

### Context

`visualize` let the model supply a STRUCTURE (one of five fixed shapes, a
dozen labels) and had Python render the page. That kept a picture cheap and
deterministic, but it is also why every result looked like the same five
cards, and why the section that showed them was a run graph with the page
hidden in a 288 px inspector frame. The maintainer's decision (2026-08-23):
an artifact is a whole page the model writes — the way Claude artifacts work
— and writing one well takes the strongest model the install has and longer
than a voice turn can hold. So the page is written by a mission worker, not
by the router brain.

### Decision

- `create_artifact(title, request, revise?, spoken_ack?)` composes the worker
  brief (`jarvis/artifacts/brief.py`: one HTML file, all assets inline, no
  network, brand palette, light/dark, the user's language; on a revision the
  previous page verbatim) and dispatches it through the mission stack — the
  same `MissionManager.dispatch` → `Kontrollierer.run_mission` path as
  `spawn_worker`, with the same lazy resolvers (AD-OC1) and the same spoken
  failure on every dead end (AU-11). The call returns within the voice budget
  with a spoken promise; completion reaches the user through the mission
  voice listener. Risk `monitor`, like `spawn_worker`; never in a worker set
  (AP-5/AP-14).
- **Ask-only, structurally.** `BrainManager._hide_artifact_tool_without_request`
  removes the tool from every turn that does not ask for an artifact
  (`jarvis/brain/artifact_gate.py`: explicit word — visualisier / Artefakt /
  Dashboard / Infografik — or a build verb next to a page noun; navigation to
  the section and definition questions never open it). Regex only (AP-11).
- The Artifacts section (`VisualizationView`, section id unchanged) shows the
  page full-size from `/api/outputs/{slug}/files/{path}/page`, served with
  `ARTIFACT_PAGE_CSP` (inline scripts allowed, every network path shut) inside
  `sandbox="allow-scripts"` without `allow-same-origin`. Source under "Code",
  the run graph that used to be the section under "Run".
- `jarvis/visuals/{spec,render,store}.py` and the gallery-as-pseudo-run store
  are retired; `jarvis/visuals/brand.py` stays (mission map + brief palette).

### Regression guards

- `tests/unit/brain/test_artifact_gate.py` (vocabulary, navigation beats the
  verb, definition questions, page nouns only next to a verb)
- `tests/unit/brain/test_artifact_tool_hide.py` (placement in the manager,
  fail-open)
- `tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_create_artifact.py` (brief reaches the
  manager verbatim, Kontrollierer runs it, NavigateSidebar, spoken failure on
  no runner / crash, revision from the archive)
- `tests/unit/artifacts/test_brief.py`, `tests/unit/artifacts/test_locate.py`
- `tests/unit/ui/web/test_outputs_routes.py::test_artifact_page_*`
- frontend: `VisualizationView.test.tsx`, `RunGraphPanel.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py` (`create-artifact` in `ROUTER_TOOLS`)

## Amendment: UltraWiki Search retired (2026-08-28)

`ultrawiki-search` leaves `ROUTER_TOOLS` together with the UltraWiki mode it
answered from. The amendment above stays as the record of why it was added;
nothing in the router changes shape, the set is simply one entry shorter.

The knowledge surface it fronted does not disappear: `wiki-recall`,
`wiki-list` and `wiki-page-read` answer the same questions from the Obsidian
vault, and they were always loaded beside it.

The `requires=` capability gate on `AppCommand`
(`jarvis/commands/capabilities.py`) goes with it. That seam existed to keep
the four UltraWiki commands out of a tool set while the mode was off, it had
no other entry, and a filter with no criterion is dead code. It returns with
the feature.

### Regression guards

- `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py` (the set no longer names the tool)
- `tests/missions/test_worker_capability_parity.py` (the worker grant)

## Amendment 2026-09-02 — Agent society voice tools

`delegate-to-agent` (risk `monitor`) and `society-status` (risk `safe`) join
`ROUTER_TOOLS`. They are the voice front door of the agent society
(`docs/agent-society/MASTERPLAN.md` §3.2): "Jarvis, let Scout research that"
becomes ONE typed `ASSIGN` envelope on the society board, acknowledged inside
the 5-second voice budget; "what is Scout doing?" is answered from the roster
and the last board events without a model call.

### Pure-Dispatcher spirit is preserved

- Neither tool spawns. `delegate-to-agent` appends an envelope; the society
  scheduler (`jarvis/society/scheduler.py`, trusted Python) applies the kill
  switch, the tier wall, delegation depth, budgets and caps and only then
  starts work under the target agent's identity. A refusal is a typed `VETO`
  the tool reads back as a spoken reason.
- Both stay out of every worker set (AP-5/AP-14): they are loaded through the
  `ROUTER_TOOLS` filter only and the society's own capability catalog lists
  them under `NEVER_GRANTED`.
- The runtime is reached through a lazy resolver (AD-OC1), so the tools are
  registered at brain build time and answer an honest "not ready" until the
  server has built the society.

### Regression guards

- `tests/unit/brain/test_routing.py` (both names in `ROUTER_TOOLS`)
- `tests/unit/plugins/tool/test_delegate_to_agent.py` (ack, unknown agent,
  veto read-back, status answers, not-ready path)
- `tests/unit/society/test_scheduler.py` (the wall the tool relies on)


## Amendment 2026-09-07 — Internal agent messages (RUB-14)

`message-agent` joins `ROUTER_TOOLS` as `message_agent`. It is an internal
communication action with risk `safe`, executed through `ToolExecutor`.
It shares `MessageAgentTool` and the scheduler's durable delivery queue with
`society_message_agent`; it never invokes an external mail connector or starts
a worker directly. `delegate_to_agent` remains the assignment path.

The lead tool binds its sender to the runtime's lead. Society tools bind their
sender to their owning session. Neither schema accepts an author. Both respect
explicit tool denial, inactive roster rows and the master kill switch.
Delivery does not authorize the recipient's subsequent external actions.

The board atomically queues new envelopes using an SQLite insertion trigger.
The scheduler serializes draining, preserves FIFO per recipient and retries busy
chats. Existing board history is not replayed by this migration. Chat receipts
use `agent_message` and `agent_message_status`, preserving sender identity and
queued/delivered/failed status through storage, API, WebSocket and both chat UIs.
A persisted delivery receipt prevents another turn when the same event is
replayed. Delivery means accepted by the chat, not successful task completion.

### Scoped external coding sessions (2026-09-08)

Persistent society agents may receive `core:coding-session` through their
per-agent grant and approval rules. This narrowly controls existing IDE coding
CLIs; it does not invoke the society scheduler or mission worker dispatcher.
The tool is absent from the global worker catalog and only added to an
authorized society chat's tools, including its subscription-seat MCP catalog,
or the lead's typed Jarvis chat under that chat's own identity and approval rules.
Router membership and the prohibition on recursive worker spawning are
unchanged. Stable workspace/pane IDs and durable request receipts preserve
project and delivery identity across asynchronous work and retries.

Supervision extends that authorized assignment without introducing a worker
spawn tool. A durable owner-bound record consumes IDE activity notifications
and starts an internal turn in the same chat via its existing message receipt
path. All terminal actions still pass ToolExecutor. Normal owned text follow-ups
may inherit monitor-tier; approval dialogs retain ask-tier and stale replies are
refused under the pane lock. Budget, kill-switch, grant and no-progress gates
apply before automatic turns. No terminal output is treated as user authorization.

Receiving turns inherit conversation provenance through task-local context;
new conversations receive fresh traces. Replies retain the trace and parent
event, so the scheduler's conversation cap remains effective. Lead replies go
to the front-page Jarvis chat. Legacy `user_message` events are not relabeled.

Guards: `tests/contract/test_internal_messages.py`, the router membership test,
`tests/unit/realtime/test_internal_message_regression.py`, and the shared
`InternalMessageBubble` tests. Voice confirmation retries share one result;
a real microphone response captured after playback is not discarded solely
because its transcript resembles the confirmation question.
