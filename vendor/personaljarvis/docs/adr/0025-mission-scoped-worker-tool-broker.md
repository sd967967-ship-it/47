# ADR-0025 — Mission-Scoped Worker Tool Broker

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-13)
**Phase:** 6 — Self-Healing Jarvis-Agents Orchestrator
**Reference:** ADR-0009, ADR-0011, AP-3, AP-5, AP-14, AP-21, AP-22

## Context

Mission workers run in isolated processes and worktrees. That isolation kept
the supervisor's connected Marketplace, MCP, and app-command tools out of the
worker capability surface. A tool could therefore be healthy and callable in
the main Jarvis while a delegated mission honestly reported that it was not
available. Directly copying connector configurations into every worker was not
acceptable: it exposed credentials, worked only for selected CLI backends, and
bypassed the supervisor's `ToolExecutor` safety path.

The production worker chain is provider-agnostic. Claude CLI, Codex CLI,
Gemini CLI, Google CLI, and API workers need one capability contract that does
not depend on a provider-specific MCP implementation.

## Decision

Personal Jarvis uses a process-local, mission-scoped worker tool broker. Each
mission receives a short-lived authenticated grant containing only
task-relevant MCP tools, connected native connector tools, and the restricted
app commands carrying an explicit `worker_allowed` Command Registry marker.
The initial action surface covers operational reads, provider health tests,
mission/task inspection, and the complete guarded Wiki workflow: deterministic
listing, recall search, vault-confined page reads, and curator-backed ingest.
CLI workers reach the grant
through a stdio MCP companion connected to a loopback-only HTTP endpoint; API
workers call the same binding directly.

The supervisor retains the live tool objects and all credentials. Every broker
request executes through the supervisor's `ToolExecutor`; workers never call
`Tool.execute()` directly. An ask-tier request remains suspended on its original
trace until an explicit approval or denial arrives. The pending call is exposed
through mission REST and CLI actions without adding a global waiting mission
state; approval resumes that exact call, while denial and timeout execute
nothing.

The mission controller owns one broker grant per worker iteration and closes it
as a bounded quiescence barrier before invoking the critic. The grant retains a
credential-free terminal outcome for every supervisor call. Critic review is
allowed only when no call remains active and every recorded call succeeded;
denied, cancelled, timed-out, failed, or outcome-unknown calls force the
existing worker-error mission path. A worker model therefore cannot ignore a
tool error and claim successful completion.

The grant fails closed. Recursive mission tools, skill execution, credential
surfaces, secret-reading names, dangerous commands, config mutation, live
desktop/Computer-Use tools, host-shell tools, and Jarvis control-CLI adapters
are never exported. Workers retain their own sandboxed worktree tools, but may
control the running Jarvis only through the explicit broker grant. Both
inventory construction and broker issuance validate the
live Command Registry marker, so a forged inventory cannot promote a denied
command. A
missing supervisor reference, empty relevant tool set, expired token, or
unsupported runtime produces no grant rather than a partially trusted one.
Catalog descriptors are resolved from the live supervisor on each list and
execute operation, and grant closure revokes the bearer and cancels active
calls.

## Consequences

- Connected capabilities remain usable after delegation without copying OAuth
  tokens, API keys, or MCP environment blocks into a worker workspace.
- All supported worker families consume the same broker contract; no provider
  name is treated as the capability boundary.
- Risk-tier evaluation, audit events, plausibility checks, and approvals remain
  centralized in `ToolExecutor`.
- A worker receives only the capabilities relevant to its mission, not the
  supervisor's complete tool catalog.
- Consequential actions wait for an explicit user decision through the mission
  API/CLI (or an already-authorized scheduled-task decision); silence never
  becomes implicit approval.
- A successful worker transcript is insufficient evidence when its broker
  completion certificate contains an unclean call; the critic is not invoked.
- The supervisor now owns a small authenticated loopback server for the
  lifetime of active grants. Tokens are revoked on completion and bounded by a
  TTL as a crash backstop.

## Alternatives considered

- **Pass original MCP configs to every worker:** rejected because configs can
  contain credentials and support differs across provider CLIs.
- **Let workers invoke connector SDKs directly:** rejected because it bypasses
  `ToolExecutor`, duplicates auth logic, and breaks the safety audit trail.
- **Expose every supervisor tool:** rejected because it reintroduces recursive
  spawn paths, secret access, off-topic actions, and excessive model schemas.
- **Keep connected tools router-only:** rejected because heavy missions that
  genuinely need a connected source would remain unable to fulfill the task.
- **Pin the feature to Claude CLI MCP support:** rejected under AP-21/AP-22;
  capability transport must work across provider families.

## Follow-up items

- Keep provider-parity tests for every supported worker backend.
- Keep an end-to-end stdio MCP test that proves list and execute behavior across
  the authenticated loopback boundary.
- Keep the credential-free mission test covering grant selection, approval
  resume, completion certification, and revocation.
- Preserve the explicit recursive-tool and secret/config deny guards.

## Amendment (2026-07-25, ADR-0030 + ADR-0031)

Grant composition widened (mechanism unchanged): the native knowledge surface
is now dynamic — the wiki triple plus gate-driven additions
(`awareness-recall` behind `[awareness].enabled`, `search_web`,
`contact-lookup`, and `ultrawiki-search` once its service gate goes live) —
see ADR-0030. Ask-tier calls inside a grant can be pre-authorized per mission
via `[phase6.safety].auto_approve_tool_families` — the gate is answered on
the bus, never bypassed — see ADR-0031. The deny guards, the credential
boundary, and the completion certificate are unchanged; observed refusals
(denied/timed-out/errored calls) no longer abort the iteration, only
integrity failures do (`WorkerToolExecutionSummary.integrity_compromised`).

## Amendment: the UltraWiki grant is gone (2026-08-28)

The dynamic grant list above named `ultrawiki-search` "once its service gate
goes live". That mode was removed on 2026-08-28, so the name is no longer part of
any worker grant. The broker itself, the deny guards and the credential
boundary are untouched.
