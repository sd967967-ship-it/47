  The design system for the Personal Jarvis DESKTOP APP — not a marketing site.
  Graphite, not void: a near-black room whose surfaces have edges you can see,
  whose ink is bright enough to read at a glance, and whose type ships with the
  app. Graphite carries the structure; colour carries meaning on top of it —
  one desaturated signal blue, four semantic tones, coloured diffs, a coloured
  run graph — on the model of Cursor's own theme, read from its installed
  build. Version 2.0 (the "black room") was rejected as "dead, like a
  skeleton"; 3.0 fixed the greys and 3.1 (same evening) gave colour its jobs
  back after the maintainer pointed at Cursor: same greys, but the diffs,
  warnings and links are coloured, and that is what makes it look finished.
  Light mode is the same system with the value scale inverted.

    On the 2.0 build: black-and-white is wanted, but this one looks dead — a
    skeleton, a funeral. Other black-and-white products (Cursor, Grok, Bolt,
    the frontier labs) look like the top of the field. The type is not
    recognisable. Not sloppy — professional.

      window in two values, 0.19 % bright pixels, 0.06 % saturated.
    what-we-took: >-
      From all three: hairlines you can actually see, meta ink at #9E–#AF
      rather than #94, body ink at #F0–#FC rather than #E6, and a room that is
      dark without being a hole. From Grok: nav labels at 500 and a composer
      with both a fill AND a rim. From Cursor: the ink ceiling below pure
      white, emptiness as composition. From ChatGPT: one type size for almost
      everything.
  why-2-0-failed: >-
    Every 2.0 value was individually defensible and the result was dead
    anyway, because three of them compounded: a 4 % room, a 14 % hairline
    (invisible on it) and 58 % meta ink (dim on it). Grey text on invisible
    boxes on black IS a skeleton. Add a remote font that a WebView often fails
    to load, and the type is "not recognisable" in the literal sense: a
    different face, width and rhythm on every cold start.

## Overview

This document describes the **Personal Jarvis desktop application**. It is the
third version in one day, and the reason is worth keeping on record.

Version 2.0 measured two reference products and derived a "black room": a 4 %
ground, surfaces lifted only when content-sized, rims kept almost invisible,
ink capped at 90 %. Every number was defensible. The maintainer's verdict on
the built result was immediate: *dead, like a skeleton; a funeral; the type is
not recognisable*. The verdict was correct. Three quiet values compounded into
one loud failure: a near-black page, hairlines the eye cannot find on it, and
meta ink too dim to read on it. Grey text on invisible boxes on black **is** a
skeleton — an outline where an object should be.

Version 3.0 keeps 2.0's structure (the surface ladder, the four inks, the three
status hues, the seven-step scale) and changes what it was wrong about:

- **Graphite, not void.** The room is `#121212`, not `#0A0A0A`. Cursor's stage
  is `#141414`, Grok's `#181716`; neither product is a hole.
- **Edges exist.** Every rim is tuned to be visible on the surface it encloses.
  A card has a fill *and* a hairline. A composer has a fill *and* a strong rim.
  The 2.0 rule "no border on something that already has a fill" is withdrawn —
  it was the single largest contributor to the skeleton.
- **Ink is bright.** Body at `#F0F0F0` (Cursor's ceiling), meta at `#A3A3A3`
  (between Grok's `#9E` and ChatGPT's `#AF`). Nothing informational sits
  below 64 %.
- **Type ships with the app.** Inter Variable, JetBrains Mono and Space
  Grotesk are bundled. A WebView that starts offline used to render the whole
  product in Segoe UI — a different face, width and rhythm on every cold
  start, which is what "not recognisable" meant in the literal sense.
- **Nothing below 11 px.** The 271 remaining `text-[7–10px]` sites were swept
  to the `micro` step in the same change.

Still neutral greys (`r = g = b` in dark, warm paper in light) for every
surface and every rim. **But no longer colourless.** 3.1 — the same evening,
after the maintainer held the 3.0 build next to Cursor — puts colour back
where it means something. Cursor's greys are practically ours; what makes
Cursor look finished is that a removed line is rose, an added one green, a
warning amber, a link blue, and all of it desaturated to one family. That is
the whole difference, and it is now ours too (see *Colour has jobs*).

## Colors

### The surface ladder

Six roles. Their brightness inverts between themes; their **role never
changes**. Nothing in the product invents a seventh surface, and no surface is
produced by multiplying a token by an opacity.

| Role | Job | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|---|
| `room` | The page and every full-bleed region. Most of the window. | `#121212` | `#F7F7F4` |
| `rail` | The navigation column and other standing chrome. Edged with `rim`. | `#171717` | `#F1F0EA` |
| `object` | A card, bubble, composer, panel or hovered row. **Content-sized only.** | `#1F1F1F` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `lift` | The answer to a pointer: hover on an object, a selected row, a field, a tile. | `#292929` | `#E6E5E0` |
| `speaker` | The user's own turn in a conversation. A quiet fill with strong ink — not a slab. | `#2E2E2E` | `#E6E5E0` |
| `float` | Menus, dialogs, tooltips — surfaces that leave the plane. | `#303030` | `#FFFFFF` + float shadow |

Steps are 5–7 byte-values apart at the bottom of the ladder, which is the
smallest distance that survives an uncalibrated monitor. Lift still scales
inversely with area: a surface wider than ~720 px stays at `room` or `rail`.

The 2.0 `speaker` at `#4D4D4D` read as a tombstone — the loudest rectangle on
the screen carrying the one thing the reader already knows. ChatGPT's user
bubble sits a single step above its page. So does ours now; the ink carries
the emphasis.

### Rims

Two values, and both must be **visible on the surface they enclose**. A rim
the eye cannot find is not restraint; it is a missing edge.

| Token | Job | Dark | Light | Visible on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rim` | Card edges, dividers, table rules, the rail's edge. | `#2B2B2B` | `#DFDDD5` | room, rail and object |
| `rim-strong` | Composer outline, floating layers, focus rings, scrollbar thumbs. | `#404040` | `#BDBAB0` | everything up to `float` |

The references draw hairlines as white at 8–20 % alpha over their ground.
`#2B2B2B` on `#121212` is white at 10 %; `#404040` is white at 19 %. That is
the measured band, not a taste.

**A fill and a rim together are the normal case.** Grok's composer is
`#201F1D` inside a 10 % white hairline; ChatGPT's is `#212121` inside 15 %.
An object with a fill and no edge sinks; an outline with no fill is a
wireframe. Both are what "skeleton" looks like.

### Ink

Four steps, each with one job.

| Token | Job | Dark | Light | On `object` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ink-strong` | Headings, headline numbers, the selected row's label. | `#FAFAFA` | `#171610` | 15.9 : 1 |
| `ink` | Body, labels, running text, list titles. | `#F0F0F0` | `#26251E` | 14.5 : 1 |
| `ink-meta` | Timestamps, secondary lines, table heads, captions. | `#A3A3A3` | `#66635A` | 6.6 : 1 |
| `ink-faint` | Placeholders and disabled text only. Never information. | `#7A7A7A` | `#8B877C` | 3.7 : 1 |

`fill` (`#FFFFFF` dark, `#26251E` light) is the accent. It paints buttons,
marks, active indicators and focus rings. **It never paints text, a byline, or
a decorative icon.**

The ceiling stays below white: `#F0F0F0` is what Cursor's brightest text
measures. But the floor for anything a person is meant to read is now 64 %,
up from 58 %, and the placeholder step is 48 %, up from 44 %. Small numbers;
the difference between "meta" and "faded".

### Colour has jobs

Read from Cursor's installed theme (`cursor-dark-color-theme.json`, 252
roles) rather than from screenshots. The recipe: neutral greys carry the
structure; colour appears only where it *means* something; every hue is
desaturated to about the same chroma so the set reads as one family. One
signal hue, four semantic tones, coloured diffs. Nothing else.

| Token | Job | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|---|
| `signal` (`--accent`) | Links, focus ring token, the active nav row's leading bar, the install caret, prose links. **Press this / follow this.** | `#81A1C1` | `#2778C1` |
| `life` (`--success`) | Running, live, connected, passed, progress. | `#3FA266` | `#007041` |
| `fault` (`--destructive`) | Failed, blocked, error, destructive action. | `#E34671` | `#BE1744` |
| `degraded` (`--warning`) | Stale, modified, partial, needs attention. | `#F1B467` | `#A46700` |
| `info` (`--info`) | Counts, new items, hints — "note this" without "something is wrong". | `#88C0D0` | `#176C74` |

`--primary` stays the white fill: the primary button, marks and the orb ring
are still ink-on-ink, as in Grok and ChatGPT. `signal` is a *colour*, not a
fill for buttons — the exception a Cursor "Install" button makes is not one
this product needs.

Binding rules. A status may **never** be encoded as `ink` or `fill`. A status
ramp may **never** render "ok" dimmer than "unknown". A success state must
actually use `life`. And a hue is never decorative: if an element is coloured,
the colour must be readable as one of the five jobs above.

### Diffs

Monochrome diffs with strike-through (3.0) are withdrawn. An added line is
green ink on green at 18 %; a removed line is rose ink on rose at 20 %. That
is Cursor's `diffEditor.*` / `gitDecoration.*` pair exactly, and it is the
single most-cited reason the maintainer named for Cursor looking finished.

### The run graph

Eleven step families on the same palette Cursor paints code in — lavender
reasoning, cyan shell and web, amber writes and deliverables, sky search,
mauve integrations, pink sub-agents, blue ignition, green landing, neutral
unknown. Two values (3.0) were honest but unreadable at a glance.

### Identity

Every conversation, agent, provider and person carries a **coloured identity
mark**: a real vendor logo where one exists (kept in full colour — the
documented exception to the neutral rule), otherwise a round avatar whose hue
is derived deterministically from the name. Never a grey placeholder, never a
monogram on a neutral disc. Identity hues sit outside the status palette and
are never read as state.

### Selection

Dragging across text answers in the theme's own material — `sheen` at 22 % —
never the engine's default blue. Selection is not a job for `signal`. It was the one saturated slab a
black-and-white product showed every time someone selected a sentence.

## Typography

### Families

| Role | Family | Ships as |
|---|---|---|
| Interface | **Inter Variable** | `@fontsource-variable/inter`, one woff2 per script subset, every weight |
| Display | **Space Grotesk** | 500 / 600 / 700 static cuts. Section titles and headline numbers only. |
| Code | **JetBrains Mono** | 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 static cuts. Every code, terminal, path and transcript surface. |

All three are bundled by Vite and fingerprinted into `dist/assets`. There is
no remote font request anywhere in the product. Licences are SIL OFL 1.1 and
are listed in `public/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`.

Inter is set with `cv02 cv03 cv04 cv11` (open shapes, single-storey a) and
**−0.01 em tracking at interface sizes** — Inter's own recommendation, and
what both Grok (−0.2 px at 14 px) and Cursor set. `reading` and `code` reset
tracking to 0 through their own declarations.

### The scale

Seven steps plus one weight variant. There is nothing between them and
nothing below them.

| Token | Size / Weight | Line height | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `display` | 24 / 600 | 1.2 | Section title, headline number |
| `page` | 20 / 600 | 1.3 | Page heading |
| `title` | 15 / 600 | 1.4 | Card title, list-row title, group label |
| `reading` | 15 / 400 | 1.6 | Chat, transcripts, documents, prose |
| `body` | 14 / 400 | 1.5 | Default interface text, controls |
| `label` | 14 / 500 | 1.5 | **Navigation rows and buttons.** The weight every reference sets its nav in. |
| `meta` | 13 / 400 | 1.45 | Timestamps, captions, secondary lines |
| `micro` | 11 / 500 | 1.4 | Badges and dense table cells. **Hard floor.** |

**11 px is the floor and it is now enforced by the tree, not the document.**
No `text-[10px]`, `text-[9px]`, `text-[8px]` survives in `src/`. ChatGPT's
smallest type is 12 px; Grok's is 13 px.

### Principles

- **Weight is hierarchy.** 400 for reading and meta, 500 for anything a
  person navigates or presses, 600 for titles. A navigation column set
  entirely in 400 grey is a list of ghosts.
- **No tiny all-caps labels** outside a badge.
- **Line height comes from the scale**, never from a `leading-*` class.
- **Tabular numerals wherever digits align.**

## Layout

Four named spacing steps and three measures, unchanged from 2.0:

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `row` | 8px | Inside a row: icon to label, chip to chip |
| `stack` | 12px | Between siblings in a list or form |
| `block` | 20px | Card padding, between related blocks |
| `group` | 32px | Between groups in a section |
| `page` | 28px | Section outer padding |

| Measure | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `reading` | 720px | Chat, transcripts, prose |
| `form` | 640px | Settings groups, single-column forms |
| `page` | 1080px | Dashboards, tables, card grids |

**A section is designed by subtraction.** Remove every wrapper that only
holds one other thing, every label that repeats its value, every count nobody
acts on. The target is ≥ 60 % of a section's pixels at `room` or `rail` —
but what remains must have edges.

## Elevation

Three levels. Depth is carried by fill and rim; shadow only when floating.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Flat | No shadow. Its own surface token. | Rows, tiles, chips — everything in the plane |
| Rim | `inset 0 1px 0` sheen at 7 % **plus a `rim` hairline** | Cards, bubbles, composers. A top edge catching light and a drawn edge. |
| Float | Real shadow + `rim-strong` ring | Menus, dialogs, tooltips only |

No decorative glows. A bloom is additive light standing in for a fill that
should have been there.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `control` | 8px | Rows, buttons, inputs, tiles, menu items |
| `surface` | 12px | Cards, bubbles, panes, popovers |
| `feature` | 16px | Composers and large feature cards |
| `pill` | 9999px | Chips, badges, avatars, status dots |

The composer moves up to `feature`: both references round their composer
more than anything else on screen (Grok 24 px, ChatGPT 28 px), and a 16 px
radius inside a 720 px measure is the restrained version of that.

**The theme never changes an element's shape** — only its value.

## Interaction

One ladder, one recipe. It only ever goes up.

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Rest | The element's own surface token |
| Hover | One step up the ladder (`object` → `lift`) |
| Selected | `lift` plus `ink-strong` on the label |
| Focus | 2px `rim-strong` ring. Never a third fill. |
| Pressed | `scale(0.98)`, 120ms |

Selection is a full-width rounded fill on the whole row, inset from the
column edge. Scrollbar thumbs are `rim-strong`; a thumb at `rim` was a thumb
nobody could find. Transitions are 120 ms on fills and 160 ms on transforms.
Everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Nesting

A child surface **steps up, never down**. It is a hard error for an element
to render darker than its parent in dark mode.

| Parent | A nested well, tile, field or table head takes |
|---|---|
| `room` | `rail` or `object` |
| `rail` | `object` |
| `object` | `lift` |
| `lift` | `float`, or no surface at all |

When the ladder runs out, stop nesting.

## States

Every section owns four states, and all four are designed.

- **Loading** renders the real container at its real height with skeleton
  bars at `sheen` 7 %. Never a centred grey word in a void, never invented
  zeros.
- **Empty** is a designed surface — `object` with a `rim` — with one sentence
  saying what will appear here and one action that makes it appear.
- **Error** says what failed and what to do. It uses `fault` on a normal
  surface, never a red-washed panel.
- **Populated** is the state everything else in this document describes.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Give every object a fill **and** an edge. Fill first, rim second, shadow
  only when floating.
- Keep the room at `room`. Lift only what is sized to its content.
- Set navigation and buttons in `label` (500), not `body` (400).
- Spend `life` green on anything that is actually running.
- Cap ink below white and reserve `fill` for fills.
- Bound the measure IN THE VIEW, on the element that needs it — a prose
  column, a form, a card grid. Never in the shell: a shell-level 1080 px
  column (tried 2026-09-01, reverted the same evening) squeezed the wiki graph
  into a thumbnail on a 4K window, tore sub-navigation columns off the left
  edge and centred every form in a sea of black. Graphs, terminals, boards
  and tables keep the whole window.
- Remove before you restyle — and check what is left still has edges.

### Don't

- Don't express depth with opacity. `bg-card/40` as a resting ground is a
  defect; depth is a named token.
- Don't write a literal colour anywhere except `terminalThemes.ts`, the one
  sanctioned exception (xterm needs resolved strings).
- Don't tune a rim until it disappears. If it cannot be seen on the surface
  it encloses, it is not a rim.
- Don't set a status in `ink` or `fill`, and never let "ok" be quieter than
  "unknown".
- Don't colour anything that is not one of the five jobs. A hue with no
  meaning is noise; five hues with meaning are the difference between a
  wireframe and a product.
- Don't use tiny uppercase labels. Don't go below 11 px.
- Don't add a shadow to anything that is not floating.
- Don't fetch a font from a remote host. Ever.

## Light mode

Light is the same system read the other way: warm paper (`#F7F7F4`) and warm
near-black ink (`#26251E`). Objects rise toward white, interaction answers
downward into warm grey, rims darken instead of lightening, and `fill`
becomes ink on paper. The 3.0 changes on paper are the same changes as on
graphite: `rim` down to `#DFDDD5` so it reads on white cards, `ink-meta`
down to `#66635A` (6.6 : 1 on paper), and the user bubble becomes a quiet
`lift` fill with strong ink rather than a black slab.

The five colour jobs keep their meaning between themes and take Cursor
Light's values (`#2778C1`, `#007041`, `#BE1744`, `#A46700`, `#176C74`).

## The Agentic IDE panes

The pane family (terminal shells, chat stage, rail, toolbar) reads the same
ladder re-derived per appearance in `terminalThemes.ts`, because a light pane
inside a dark app is a supported combination and xterm cannot read a CSS
token. The values there are this document's values: dark shell over `#121212`,
rims at white 12 %, float `#303030`, ink `#F0F0F0` / `#A3A3A3` / `#7A7A7A`.
The 16 ANSI slots are Cursor's own terminal set (rose, green, `#D2943E`,
`#81A1C1`, `#B48EAD`, `#88C0D0`, brights one step lighter) so a CLI's output
and the app's chrome share one palette; the light pane takes Cursor Light's.

## Enforcement

These rules are checked, not remembered. Each has a gate in `scripts/ci/`
alongside the existing German and private-key gates.

| Gate | Fails on |
|---|---|
| No literal colour | A hex, `rgb()`, or Tailwind palette class in `.tsx`, `.ts` or `.css` outside `terminalThemes.ts` |
| No opacity hierarchy | `bg-(card\|background\|muted)/[0-9]` or `bg-sheen/` used as a resting fill |
| No negative hover | `hover:bg-background/` |
| Type floor | `text-[10px]` or smaller |
| No admin caps | `uppercase` in `views/` outside a badge |
| No remote fonts | `fonts.googleapis.com` or any `@import url(http` in `.css` |

## Known gaps

- Motion is specified only as durations. A typing indicator, a streaming
  cursor and a run-in-progress pulse are still not designed; "dead" for an
  interactive app is partly that nothing moves.
- The navigation column lists ~20 sections at one weight and one indent.
  This version makes them legible; grouping them is a product decision the
  theme cannot make.
- Icon size and stroke weight are not yet audited across the view tree.
- The wallpaper feature's readability floors were derived on the 2.0 ladder
  and have not been re-tuned.
